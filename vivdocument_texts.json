["hey welcome to Vive church and our podcast I know that each and every message you're going to find in this series this life I now live is going to minister to you I believe it's going to minister life to you as you receive it so why don't you dig into the word prepare your hearts to receive Revelation as God speaks to you today God bless you ready for the word of God how many people just all week long have been anticipating the opening of God's word coming together I know you can open God's word on your own and I highly encourage you to do that but when we come together around the word of God we ain't coming around the Quran we're coming around the Living Word of God today so I'm trying to set your expectation for life to fill your bones to fill your heart this is the word of Jesus Christ so I want you to go to acts real quick Acts chapter 12 as we continue in our Series this life I now live I I want to share a story in fact I'm GNA kind of preach a story to you today how many people like stories how many people got a Netflix subscription it's going to be better for you Acts chapter 12 I want you to go all the way to verse 20 let's let's kind of start there it says now Herod was very angry with the people of Ty and siden so they sent a delegation to make peace with him because their cities were dependent upon herod's country for food the delegates won the support of blastus herod's personal assist assistant and an appointment with Herod was granted when the day arrived Herod put on his Royal robes sat on his throne and made a speech to them the people gave him great Ovation shouting it's the voice of a God not a man instantly an angel of the Lord struck Herod with sickness because he accepted the people's worship instead of giving glory to God so he was consumed with worms and died meanwhile the word of God continued to spread and there were many new Believers it just so happens we've been preaching from acts and people are dying coincidence maybe not I want to speak to you today from the subject never let it rest never let it rest you sure you ready for God's word all right I want you to do something really welcoming like I want you to welcome the neighbor next to you thank them for sitting next to you then take your seat would you do that quick thank you God bless you God bless you today I want to take us another degree deeper in our understanding of the fear of God as we track with the early church you over the past several installments we have extracted specific moments that essentially marked the early church moments you could say that matured the church and moments that developed the church's understanding of what it truly looks like to walk with God as one who has been crucified with Christ because it was different they had to learn how to live different from what they had lived before what they had signed up to was not a country club but it was a complete different calling for their life they had been transformed and they had been changed from the inside out it's what our series script says in Galatians 2:20 lays it out pretty plainly it says I've been crucified with Christ it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith what the early church was coming to terms with is how I might look like the same on the outside but I'm Different on the inside I might not have changed visibly but watch The Way I Live the words I speak what comes from the inside out is not going to be fleshy it's going to be faithy every word's going to be different I ain't going to be talking about how anxious I am about my job I'm not going to be talking about how nervous I am about the economy I'm not going to be confused about how life is going I'm going to live by faith which means I'm going to trust in the Lord I'm going to be the one in the workplace when everyone's freaked out and fearful saying God's got it I'm going be the one that used to be the one that was nervous and anxious all the time on meds but I'm the one that that says I put my trust in God they they were in the flesh but they were living by faith so they'll learn to live different now what we have with the book of Acts the best way I can paint this for you is we get a front row seat to the building of the church through the Holy Spirit we have the church's formation through persecution we also see the church being shaped through significant events for instance by Acts chapter we see the radical salvation of Paul the Apostle and we find the church is now graining gaining strength and momentum it says this in Acts chap 9:31 the church then had peace throughout Judea Galilee and Samaria and it became stronger as the Believers lived in the fear of the Lord and with the encouragement of the Holy Spirit it grew in numbers I love this about the early church as they began to move in power the church became stronger they became for ified they weren't weak like they used to be they were strengthened through the apostles teaching now let me give you a preview to what the apostles were teaching they were teaching things that would offend the Saints today no doubt like like 100% what they would teach would offend the modern Saints but what often clears out seats in a modern church was strengthening the early church they were like hit us with the hard stuff apostle Not only was it strengthening like a resistant muscle at the gym like weight on a muscle it was the word for their Spirit was strengthening their very Souls because they were putting through some rigorous spiritual training what they found is that the church was also growing in number people were added so the individuals in the church were strengthened and more people were coming in the church was growing so what we find here is that the church was not only gaining momentum but the book of Acts also begins to track with two prominent leaders within the move of God you got Paul as I mentioned who had been freshly commissioned by God with the mandate to take the gospel to the Gentiles until now the gospel by the way had only ever been preached to the Jews but given the Jews resistance their hardened Hearts the gospel is now breaking out that's what the good news will do the good news tends to break out the the the good news cannot be contained it's not it's not limited to your fervency it'll break out with or without you it'll break out it'll find a way it'll get preached by the people that least likely and here we've got the gospel El of Jesus Christ that has been contained exclusively to the Jews but now we find it's it's breaking out God's got a servant in Paul but it's interesting because what we find is another prominent leader in Acts is Peter Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ who was traveling place to place exclusively visiting Jewish leaders he was or or Believers he was encouraging them in their newf found Faith he was praying for them and he was performing Miracles the way Jesus did by the way he goes this one place and he raises this like this lame guy just the way Jesus did he prays for him and he now starts walking at the same time he prays for this woman who is dead named Dorcas and she comes back to life I mean the church at this point is going off it's out of control and I'm just giving you here not a history lesson but I'm giving you some context as we kind of track toward acts chap 12 there's something I need you to understand about Acts chapter 12 but there some few things I have to show you in the leadup to acts chap 12 for you to get the understanding of what God was doing because in Acts chapter 10 we find an extremely pivotal moment involving Peter and a Roman army officer who was by the way a gentile check out the way acts 10 introduces this particular Roman officer it says in cesaria there lived a Roman army officer named Cornelius who was the captain of the Italian regimen he was a devout God fearing man as was everyone in his household he gave generously to the poor and prayed regularly to God he wasn't part of the church he wasn't Jewish he wasn't even religious however he was devoted generous and God-fearing I mean this dude is putting some Christians to shame he ain't even in the church he's a Roman and as it turns out what we find is both Cornelius and Peter they have a vision at the same time different places at the same time you got Peter out here just Vis visiting the Jewish Believers doing his rounds going and encouraging him just performing crazy Miracles Raising Dead people that kind of stuff and one night he's he's posted up at at Simon the Tanner's house I I just get an image like it's a really cool house to be a part of you know he has like you know leather furniture and all that kind of stuff because that's what he does he's a Tanner and uh anyway he posts up there and one evening I feel like it's like a cool house because he has like a roof top where you can go and just Lounge so so Peter's Up on the Rooftop you got the image with me Simon the Tanner's house probably like a little tan couch up on the the the rooftop Simon's up there the Bible says he's hungry which is important to understand the vision and and he and he goes into a trance I ain't never been that hungry but close 10 days of fasting he'll do it and anyway he's up there and he has a vision the vision is this white sheet that's coming down down from heaven and on the sheet are all kinds of animals you got reptiles and you got all these animals that Jewish people considered unclean then the word of the Lord comes to him as he seen this Vision Peter get up kill and eat and Peter says Nah I ain't ever touch anything unclean and then the word of the Lord chastised him and says Peter do not call unclean what I've called clean in other words the Lord is saying if I cleaned it it clean doesn't matter about his past doesn't matter what it's been like if I deem it clean it's clean Peter Peter goes yes Lord and as he does that he gets a word from a gentile to come and visit his home coincidence I don't think so it's like God planned it and so what we see is we see Peter then goes to the house of Cornelius and it's interesting because when he goes there he he sees Cornelius it's a powerful moment it not only results in cornelius's whole household getting saved but they were all filled with the Holy Spirit every single person in the household much to the amazement of Peter who had never predicted or imagined or foreseen the gospel going beyond the Jews in his Limited worldview in his whole Paradigm he had only ever foreseen seen the gospel being for the Jews now I know it's crazy to you and I because we see the reach of the Gospel today but for him and his whole world being Jewish this was life altering and believe it or not while this was God's plan breaking out of human limitation while this was God not waiting for a person to get on board before he does it God just doing it and people catching up it actually lands Peter in hot water with the Jewish Believers back in Jerusalem understand Peter's out here he's out here on the road he's out here ministering he's out here in the different hoods he's helping people know Jesus and he's experiencing the grace of God for not just the Jews but the Gentiles then he gets word from the Believers back in Jerusalem who stayed saying I know about this so then what we find and I love this this is crazy we find acts 11 is labeled Peter explains himself self Peter explains his actions he explains himself I I'm just want to say this this is a little side note I've been ministering for a little while but the longer I Minister the more I see defined two groups within the church the contributors and the critics two groups like a dividing line down the church you get the critics and then you get the contributors and the critics critique the contributors but the contributors are too busy contributing to critique choose this date now where you'll be well Peter does it he not only shares how went down he literally summarizes it with this very powerful statement I want to show you to it's in Acts chap 11 verse 15 it says as I began to speak Peter continued the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he fell on us at the beginning it you can hear in his tone I'm just a Sur surises you guys I'm just I just it just happened then then I thought of the Lord's words when he said John baptized with water but you baptized with the Holy Spirit and since God gave these Gentiles the same gift he gave us when we believed in Lord Jesus Christ who was I to stand in God's way did you see that who was I to I mean this will shut down a school counsel like you've never seen before Oh I got reasons but my conclusion is who was I now now if anybody Peter was somebody he walked with Jesus he he he knew Jesus better than the rest of them he he he had some experience he literally just raised someone from the dead that gets you cred in church by the way you ever want to get some leadership pathway raise someone from the dead we'll take no notice we will we'll talk about it in our board meeting and we'll we'll whiteboard it so if anybody could kind of get in the way it was Peter but he had the humility to say who was I who was I to get in the way of God's plan I love that at some point in your walk with God you need to ask yourself is what I'm doing or is what I'm not doing potentially getting in the way of what God's doing can someone turn this on I I don't know how to play keys but I would just double key I would just I would preach that moment if we just had a keyboard player is what I'm doing or what I'm not doing potentially disrupting what God's doing [Music] oh I don't know who to preach to trying to find someone who's going to agree with the word of God that God's called you and he wants you and he wants to use you but sometimes what you're doing or what you're not doing is not what God's wanting me doing if I was God if I was God I'd be so mad with you I'm trying to do something here I'm trying and you don't want to go to the Gentiles you want to stick with what's comfortable I'm going have to break out that would be my conclusion if I was God and I had a plan and you were stubborn I said I'm going have to break out I'm I have to do it I have to break out I wanted to use you but I have to do something I don't want to be limited to you so I'm going break out how many people know God can break out okay now you might be thinking how on Earth could little old me get in the way of God maybe by forgetting that this is all about God like you ain't the hero I want to I want to break every romcom narrative that you've ever believed and let you know you aren't the main character of your story somewhere up the back there we ain't the main character of this thing oh you get to be the main character of your story no you don't there is a main character he's called the captain of our faith he is the king of kings and the Lord of lords it's centered on Jesus Jesus Christ is the hero he saved us you didn't save yourself if anything you are Supporting Cast to the main story Jesus we live in a day and age where we feel like we have to promote ourselves it's like this pressure that comes I don't I'm not going to just go down and and and you know I'm not I'm not going to destroy your fantasies of social media cool for you I love it share what you're into not what you are share what you're into you're trying to promote who you are look at me notice me no no you meant to promote what you're into which is Jesus let me stand in the background let me put him in the foreground it's all about Jesus I want you to know Jesus when you look at my life see Jesus see this is where we get it twisted we're trying to be a celebrity when the only one we're celebrating ultimately is Jesus Jesus is the king of kings Jesus is the Lord of lords Jesus is the captain of our faith Jesus is the one who gave his life so that I could live this life I now live I live in the flesh but I live by faith because of Jesus so Jesus Jesus in fact I want to show you how simple and how subtle this can happen getting in the way of God because in Acts chapter 12 we find King Herod comes into play now if you read the Bible a bit you're going to notice Herod comes up a lot like a lot a lot like Herod will come up in different time zones and different eras and it can kind of be confusing this fool still around like he's still like he was there at the beginning when Jesus was born trying to kill babies and now he's in Acts chap 12 like is this a NeverEnding Marvel character like what what's going well well you got to know that Herod is it's kind of more of a position than a person it's it's a person but it's also more of a position because and let me let me kind of show you for instance at the time of Jesus's birth we find a Herod which is Herod the Great self-named who had learned about the wise men and their plan to ordain the next king now why would he be mad about that because what you need to understand is that he is an illegitimate King in the lines of Kings in Israel's history he was an illegitimate one because he wasn't born into Kingdom he was appointed a kingdom from the Roman senate now the Roman senate would do this as a as an Empire that was building their empire they would go into different regions and they would establish their own Kings they would remove the leadership from that country that region that religion they would instill their own p s their own people set them up with Kings and Authority that would end up being uh their their order would be worked through them this was Herod now Herod liked his Newfound kingship and also wanted to protect it so the moment he got word that these wise men were going to anoint the one true king he wanted to do everything he could to subvert that plan even if it meant killing kids now the son of Herod the Great was Herod and Antipas who Jesus was sent to during his trial and eventual crucifixion it was the same Herod that beheaded the John John the Baptist now the Herod that we have here in Acts 12 is a different Herod this is Herod AG grippa the grandson of Herod the Great and he is he desperate for attention like if you need to know anything about Herod Agrippa he he's so desperate for affection and for attention he's fleshy he's showing Flesh on Instagram that's that's how desperate he is he he's looking for likes is that too real he's literally look he's everything he does is for affection he wants the people to like him he knows that the whole line and lineage of their family is illegitimate so they try and please people to win affection and so he goes about and he kills James that wins some affection and he puts Peter in prison and the Jews like it right and so what we find here is this is the this is the Herod that the Bible is talking about now now something to note is that Israel throughout the Old Testament has a history of Kings these were kings that God allowed as an instrument of building his kingdom however many kings would forget that they were building God's kingdom and instead build their empire they would in the process of their role which was to build the kingdom honor the King of Kings they would build their empire now it goes without saying but I'm going to say it are you in danger of forgetting or forfeiting building his kingdom for your Empire about it it was a question on an accusation take it any way you will reflect it or deflect it it's up to you but would you potentially is there any chance that you could be building your Empire instead of building his kingdom because it actually happens way more subtly than you think let let me let me take you back to the story that we started with because here you got Herod who was so emotional he's so emotional he's mad with the people of Ty and sidon now now the people of Ty and sidon they they know that this isn't going to go well with them if King herod's mad with you because he's very emotional he likes likes and and he don't like us all right so they know this ain't going to go well so they come up with a plan to suck up to Herod Okay Age Old plan and check it out it says when the day arrived let me remind you of the story Herod he got dressed up he put on his Royal robes he sat on his little throne and he made a speech to them check this out verse 22 the people gave him a great Ovation shouting it's the voice of a God not a man I mean how cheesy is this this is the cheesiest thing I've ever heard in my life like he literally says a speech and they're like are you Angelic are you for real you are are you sure you're not a god look that was amazing like I've heard some messages but that I want a message that was pure Revelation that was so deep my life's transformed can I touch you are you oh my God I'm feeling the power they're literally cheesing up crazy crazy level pandering crazy like obvious anybody had like obviously sucked up to you anybody like obviously given you like tried to inflate your ego and most of the time like I mean I was believing it up until you said that part now yeah no but it's so cheesy it works like this shows how desperate he is for affection that the cheesiest of cheesy corny lines Works check it out it says it says it says that instantly an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a sickness because he accepted the people's worship instead of giving glory to God can you get the parallels that he accepted worship instead of giving he received instead of giving you sticking with me I'm trying to go to right pace the 11:30 service he he accepted worship he received worship instead of giving Glory by the way side note this is the downfall of Lucifer by the way Lucifer who was meant to orchestrate the worship of Heaven desired worship for himself which was the downfall o of Lucifer you see that in Isaiah and some different scriptures like that but ultimately we're not meant let me say we're not built to receive worship you ain't built for that you're built to give worship another way I could say it is never let it rest Glory that is just just never just never let it never let it rest you might not think that you're in danger of of doing this because no one honors you maybe maybe you've said this ain't no one respect me around here I don't know what you say but it's not just about receiving honor it's about not giving honor oh help me Preach Today I don't want to lose you but your quietness will make me pause and extend this to an hour long if I have to double tap on everything so just just nod if you're with me and you know what I'm talking about you're not you're not built to receive you're built to give you never let it rest the glory of God and it's not just about getting honor it's about not giving honor my my pastor used to always say never let the glory rest never let the glory we're meant to handle it not hold it it's different you're meant to handle it you're meant to Steward it you're not meant to hold it holding on to Glory holding on to that statement holding on to that thing that happened 24 years ago that someone said over your life and now you keep bringing it up into every conversation we've heard it all right you were going to be the next big thing got it but that's what happens when you ho it and hold Glory becomes your identity instead of handling it in a way that is actually stewarding of Glory this is what we see modeled with the godhead even between Jesus God the son God the father and the Holy Spirit in John 5: 19 it says so Jesus explained I tell you the truth the Son of God can do nothing by himself he does only what he sees the father doing whatever the father does his son also does he gives glory to the father constantly in the same way we feel we find God the Father glorifies the Son in Matthew 3:17 saying and behold a voice from Heaven said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well please God is up in heaven watching Jesus get baptized the moment he comes up out of the water and the Holy Spirit descends upon him God says it's my son and I'm pleased can't help it just can't help it just on Glory just give him glory it's it's him it's my son then we also see the Holy Spirit honors Jesus Jesus says this in John 16:13 when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all Truth for he will not speak on his own authority but whatever he hears he will speak and he will declare to you the things that are to come he will glorify me for he will take what is mine and declare it to you so even among the godhead glory is constantly given Herod received worship completely forgetting his role was to give worship as a king in God's kingdom he was meant to facilitate worship to the King of Kings actually let me show you something real crazy can I can I show you something crazy anybody just like love the Bible like you just you would consider yourself like low-key Bible nerd anybody any low-key Bible nerds any highkey Bible nerds anybody anybody want to just leave right now because you're surrounded by so many Nerds I love the Bible now now sometimes there's a danger in just you know selecting tracks and not listening to the whole album you got to be an album guy there's there's Artistry in the album the way an album's put together it's going to build and by song three you're in deep and and and you're going to come up to a lot of moment and and there's you got to read through the chapters because there's going to be some nuggets for you that's going to go pop up somewhere else and if you reading isolation you'll miss the connections I I'll show you something real crazy cuz we're in Acts chap 12 with Herod if we go back to Acts chapter 10 where Peter was doing his rounds and visiting folk in the Jewish people it says this uh when he comes to cornelius's house it says they arrived acts 10:24 in ceria the following day Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and his close friends so it's a full house as Peter entered his home check this out Cornelius fell at his feet and worshiped him but Peter pulled him up and said stand up man I'm a human just like you it's right there in scripture two parallel perspectives on what we do with Glory Herod who's so desperate gets praise and receives it Peter goes into Cornel he literally goes down to worship Him and Peter's like yo yo yo yo yo hey hey hey up come on hey get up no one watching all right cool I'm safe don't worship me I'm just a human he didn't act like a celebrity he roll say yeah the apostles here kiss my hand he W the pope receiving praise he said don't worship me I'm just a human being give glory to God give Glory Peter didn't let the glory rest Herod received worship and as a result the Bible says he was consumed by worms and died that's a bad way to go I'm just going to I'm just going to let you know it's are you saying that by not giving Glory uh I'm going to die no not right away [Music] but worms work slow maybe things begin to Decay I mean I'm letting the fear of God just come into our services you're saying that Pastor of that church said that if we don't glorify God we're going to die no the Bible Ain that it's literally in the Bible he began to die he began it started worms from the inside started to consume him it's like a it's a decaying that's an eroding it's that's it's it's it doesn't it's not on the outside it starts on the heart it starts on the inside maybe it starts with a lack of reverence and then builds into full-blown irreverence it's like an outward display of an inward Decay that's how I like to put it my mom Pentecostal mom she she loved to quote Matthew 12 what's in the heart the mouth speaks what's in the heart she wouldn't let us get away with anything cuz what's in the heart the mouth speaks the mouth can only speak what's in the heart so if you're talking bad your heart's corrupt kept us accountable with every word it came from Jesus by the way anybody anybody ever go to their High School reunion any anybody ever been to like a high school re reunion not many of you go to high school reunions it's funny anybody I'm sure it was weird I don't know what you're were expecting I never went to mine cuz I had Facebook and I could just see I didn't need to talk to them I saw I could see where they were at and you know what I concluded it's no surprise to me that the guys that would call teachers by their first name were also the ones that spent time in prison it's funny how that goes together cuz what starts as a mere lack of reverence will build into full-blown irreverence we don't respect the teacher you won't respect the law are you with me this is a Decay this is what happens on the inside that when we don't honor the Lord and we don't give Glory something you might not die there on the spot but maybe something starts to eat away in a road where you're so reverent you don't even recognize God it's all about you the problem when it's all about you it's all about you that's the problem so everything's dependent on you so that you have to get you out of your mess when it's all about God when you find you're in a mess because of you you have God to pull you out it's way better but if I got me here I better get me out [Music] I got to let you know something you know when we fail to give God glory for the things he's done it doesn't mean God won't be glorified the truth is God will get Glory God's going to get it regardless of whether we honor the Lord or whether we don't honor the Lord God will still be glorified as much as I would love to be able to preach to you if you don't glorify God he's not getting he's it's not it's not the truth God's glory is not dependent on you it simply means we miss out on being the ones to give it cuz I love this about the Bible it's straight up Savage it says after Herod failed to give glory to God it says verse 24 meanwhile the word of God continued to spread and there were were many new Believers like what a slap in the face to Herod who thought it was all about him he literally dies meanwhile Kingdom advances oh my God I love this so much even all the people that thought you know what I don't know if I'm ready to serve God with my whole heart as if I'm just going to I'm just going to try this out meanwhile the church is still building Meanwhile we're planning in modna Meanwhile we're going to keep extending the kingdom meanwhile people are being commissioned going to India to serve God and build his kingdom meanwhile in other words regardless that's another way to put it regardless of your praise regardless of your heart regardless of your apathy God will get Glory regardless of what you want to do meanwhile God's kingdom is still advancing how significant do you feel [Music] now thought that somehow you can keep God at Bay with your delayed timelines and your self-centeredness it doesn't work like that whether you're Christ centered or self-centered God still gets Glory maybe not through you but the less gifted person that you've been wondering how's God going to use them he'll just do it he'll break out he'll he'll he'll break all the way out of your gifted self that's apathetic and find someone far simpler who is more obedient than you and he will work through [Music] them you with your you may and your degrees and all your successes saying I I'll just when I'm ready no no when God's ready when God's ready in whatever condition I am find me obedient I I want to be way more obedient than I am [Music] gifted meanwhile it's right there meanwhile I love I would do you a major disservice as a pastor if I was to tell you that the plan of God on planet Earth and the expansion of his kingdom is dependent on you that if you participate that if that if you don't serve that if you don't give that if you don't turn up on time the kingdom of God will be handed it won't if you decide to take Sunday out in the sun instead of being in the house of God that doesn't stop God getting Glory it might through you but not the glory he still gets cuz God God's glory will break out God is not I'm going to encourage you get ready for it I'm about I'm about to encourage them pal I'm about I'm you ready for this God is not dependent on you God is not limited by you God is Not restricted by you God achieves everything his word sets out to achieve that's Isaiah 55 but God allows you that's the encouragement to be part of what he's doing if you choose not to Meanwhile he'll use the person next to you don't look at them sideways just look at you in fact stand your feet with me I want to pray for [Music] you the kingdom of God advances With or Without You but we get to come in reverence and be included in the plans of God we get to I'm not meant to hold this as if I'm holding God at pay when the conditions are right and when I've achieved what I need to achieve then I'll glorify you I've had Business Leaders tell me when I get successful and when we get money then we'll honor God meanwhile the person working it in and out is bringing their tithe to the Lord and is doing more than your riches are doing in your bank account it's advancing the kingdom in Moder [Music] meanwhile while you've got a grand plan that you're going to get your skill set and your speech together and you're going to get a platform for yourself the person who's just sharing the gospel with their coworker has already got their name written in the animals of Heaven saying look at this hero for extending the kingdom of God like an evangelist meanwhile while you're holding it you're letting it rest it's got no power but when I handle it and I give glory to God it ain't going to rest on me I'm going to use what I got to glorify God watch as it holds so much power it brings transformation to people's lives [Music] n [Music] [Music]", "hey welcome to Vive church and our podcast I know that each and every message you're going to find in this series this life I now live is going to minister to you I believe it's going to minister life to you as you receive it so why don't you dig into the word prepare your hearts to receive Revelation as God speaks to you today God bless we're in a series called this life I now live this life I now live so why don't when we turn together to the book of Acts it's the book of Acts for short it's the acts of the Holy Spirit through the apostles is the long version of that and I want you to specifically go to Acts chapter 5 because in Acts chapter 5 I want to kind of Center us there in a scripture that probably doesn't get preached that often and for obvious reasons Acts chapter 5 let's go ahead from the start verse one it says but there was a certain man named ananas who with his wife saf sold some property he brought part of the money to the apostles claiming it was the full amount with his wife's consent he kept the rest then Peter said ananas why have you let Satan fill your heart you lied to the Holy Spirit and you kept some of the money for yourself the property was yours to sell or not to sell as you wished and after selling it the money was also yours to give away how could you do a thing like this you weren't lying to us but to God as soon as ananas heard these words he fell to the floor and died everyone who heard about it was terrified then some young men got up wrapped him in a sheet and took him out to be buried about 3 hours later his wife came in not knowing what had happened and Peter asked her was was this the price you and your husband receed for your land yes she replied that that was the price and Peter said how could the two of you even think of conspiring to test the spirit of the Lord like this the young men who buried your husband are just outside the door and they will carry you out too instantly she fell to the floor and died when the young men came in and saw that she was dead They carried her out and buried her be beside her husband verse 11 great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what happened anybody excited for the word of God today [Music] I want to preach to you from the subject get a grip get a grip and as you prepare your hearts for God's word I would be more than happy if you would find maybe four or five people and with a firm grip give them a good handshake before you take your seat would you do that come on get a grip get a grip get a grip give someone a good grip handshake and go ahead and take your seats amen so I want to begin today by dropping us right into the formation phase of the early church this is actually what we're going to find in the book of Acts in and for context what you're going to find in Acts is the church has begun in spectacular fashion the church began with a bang you could put it in Acts chapter 1 we have the Ascension of Jesus and ultimately Jesus himself directs the apostles to wait for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit what you're going to find in Acts chapter 2 is not only the outpouring of the Holy Spirit but you begin to see the immediate effects of the Holy Spirit as the church begins to grow as Peter preaches 3,000 people get saved and as a result we see these new found converts to Christ begin to form a faith community called The Church in Acts chapter 3 we then find Miracles are happening amongst the church Miracles that cannot even be be explained Miracles that began by simply Peter and John going to the 3:00 prayer service and as they came across a who asked for money Peter said well I ain't got any money but what I do have I give to you in the power of Jesus rise up and walk he healed which landed them in some hot water with the Jewish leaders but as they stood be in front of the the Jewish Council it's fascinating to find out that hard facts of a healing cannot be denied and not only were Peter and John release but they begin to pray a prayer that literally shakes the building that they're in you probably don't know this but I want to show you Acts chapter 4 because it's so cool in verse 29 this is the prayer that PR Peter prayed he said and now Lord look upon their threats and Grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal and signs and wonders to perform through the name of your holy servant Jesus verse 31 and when they had prayed check this out the place in which they were gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness I find this so interesting because last week we read in Hebrews the author gives us a very clear warning saying in Hebrews 12 that all of creation will be shaken so that only unshakable things will remain that's what the writer of Hebrews tells us is coming there's a shaking coming in the end of days we also see that as the church began it began with some shaking my conclusion is God likes to shake things God likes to shake things up God likes to see when things get complacent when we get comfortable when we get what I would say casual maybe in our convictions that God loves to come along and at the right time give a bit of a shake likes to shake things up now what we see in Acts chapter 5 is that God was doing something that's that's kind of the best way to describe it God was there was something happening this was new this hadn't been done before what we see in the early church was brand new no model for it people were getting saved lives were being transformed Miracles were actually happening and they were forming a community so God was doing something they were a part of something all of them in the same way I want to argue that as the church today we are part of something I'm talking about you and I I'm talking about us as the body of Christ as the people of God collectively one body one building one bride but individually we are answerable for what we do you see I'm actually convinced that as the church expands and the more ground we take the more people that are added it actually matters more how we hold this thing that we're a part of it would be so easy the bigger things get the more we can hide the more the less we could do nor insignificant we can be but I'm literally convinced the that the more the kingdom expands the more onus is put on the on the me for the we because God is a part of something we are a part of something but it's the me and the we that I need to take ownership for and this is what we saw or what we now see with the early church as we look back on the early church we can see that most most of the Believers they were responding right to this new thing that God was doing this something that God was doing that they hadn't been able to explain before most people were responding right however there were some within the community that were inauthentic let's just say that two people in particular ananas and saf these two now what I find fascinating about these two is we do not get too much detail about their background we we don't know too much about their past we we don't even know if they were new to The Community of Faith were they a part of the 3,000 people that got saved when Peter preached with such boldness on the day of P Pentecost that there are among the crowd that heard the words and were convicted in their soul and made a decision to follow Christ and were now in the community of Believers were they in the initial 3,000 or were they in the additional 2,000 that added up until this point because the church at this time wor about 5,000 people regardless of when and where they and how they came into the Community of Faith what we do know is that they were a couple or people of means they were potentially High net worth individuals since they had a field they had a field we also know they certainly like the benefits of being part of the church I mean it was obviously that they were motivated and moved they loved this new community that they were a part of because not only were Miracles happening but needs were being met and never before had they seen generosity like this never before had they or anyone seen generosity like this there was a culture that was different people were literally living generously to the church the Bible says that people were selling things and bringing things so that anybody who had would give and anybody who lacked had lack no longer because people were coming together there was this radical generosity that was permeating this brand new Community of Faith that had just formed God was doing something and they were caught up in the culture they were unfamiliar with this culture because they came from the culture of the world the culture of the world is not generous the culture of the Kingdom is generous the culture they had come from was different you see the culture they were used to the the way that they were oriented to to money was a was a consumeristic culture that was the culture of society at that day it was a culture where money most probably meant power money certainly meant security and certainly meant status and safety but now they were part of something different something new something unusual something that hadn't seen before that they they had they had transitioned from a culture that identified them with the world and now they were they were living a culture that identified them with Christ you see sometimes the only way the world sees you live different is by your culture sometimes the way that you are a signpost that your life has now lived different is by the way you Steward your life the way you conduct your life and the way you give it's a blatant evidence that the culture of the Kingdom has gripped your life because it's different from the way the world conducts their life and so they were out of the world they were now in the kingdom and radical generosity was permeating everything that they were a part of I mean sure they were used to handling theirs but now they were witnessing a radical generosity and it was inspiring them in fact the the Bible reveals that ananas and saf were particularly inspired by Barnabas Barnabas whose real name was actually Joseph for some reason but went by Barnabas check this out we see Barnabas in in in the previous chapter in Acts chapter 4 verse 36 it says for instance there was Joseph the one the apostles nicknamed Barnabas he was from the tribe of Levi and came from the island of Cyprus he sold a field that he owned and brought the money to the apostles so they actually got an idea from Barnabas Barnabas who had come from Cyprus Barnabas who had also found his way into the Community of Faith who was also now a follower of Christ was so compelled about what God was doing he had this idea I got this field I'mma sell it and I'm going to give it I I could tell you about some of the people and some of the couples in our church who are literally sitting here in this service who have sold their homes to build God's house people who have sacrificed significantly who are In This Very Room who are responsible for where our church is today which means that what Barnabas began is still having a ripple effect through the church today it wasn't just they inspired Safa and ananas but they're inspiring people today through the kingdom culture of generosity it's a radical radical generosity had grip the Believers and anany and saf they see what Barnabas does and and I don't I don't even really know if this is exactly how the conversation went between husband and wife I I will add a little bit of creative coloring just for context because the Bible doesn't specifically say I feel like we got some poetic license to assume and don't worry what what I'm about to say does not damage the text in any way but I'm pretty sure it started with ananas saying hey Safara yeah ananas hey did you hear about Joseph uh Joseph the blacksmith no no no no not Joseph the blacksmith uh uh Joseph the son of theopus no no not Joseph son of offis uh Joseph from cap not Joseph from just tell me who it is you know Barnabas oh that Joseph yeah do you hear what he did he he sold a field and he and he took the prophets and he gave all the prophets to the church hey that that was a that was a good was that the field that was down by the corner that that block yeah that was a good how much did he get for it Anan I don't know but it would have been a lot and he gave it all to the church yeah that guy's gangster hey Safara yeah ananas I was thinking we got that field oh that's right that field down by Gethsemane I I know we had plans for that field but I I kind of feel that that maybe we should do what what Joseph did you mean Barnabas yeah that's I think we should do what Barnabas did I think we should sell the field and wouldn't it be so cool if we too came with that generosity I mean everyone's doing it it's in the Kingdom like I know we wouldn't do this before I know your dad never wanted us to spend money or give money to the church I know your dad criticizes us every time we front up and we tell him how much we give to the church and that we tithe regularly and he mocks us for us but he doesn't get it we get it I feel like we could sell the field and we could bring it and we could honor the Lord and we could trust God are you sure an I I I know you haven't had that consistent work lately that's kind of our Nest Egg it's kind of where our security is no I'm sure I'm sure that God's Got Us Now how do I know the conversation went like this because they did it they did it they Lally did it they did it and by the way they got blessed they literally took that field they sold it and they got real blessed God really blessed them with the sale how do I know they got really blessed because when the money landed in their hand they said whoa that's a lot and that second thoughts like oh whoa what whoa that's that's that's a lot I didn't I didn't know the market was that good right now I I didn't realize that these games I don't even know if the church can handle that much money been told that once or twice that's a that's a lot and and they literally go from generosity the idea of it and they decided let's let's hold some back let's hold some back I don't even know how that conversation went but I'm sure I could speculate it's like man we just got man look how much we got for the field I'm so excited to give I can't wait to bring this on Sunday but you know we do have uh do have my teeth to get fixed remember and and I know every time I smile at scares you but like we could fix that and give and and I know you've been working double overtime shifts and and and Lord knows we need a vacation so maybe we could maybe we could do that and this and and and you know what you know I plan on having kids you know I heard that education is expensive we really got to secure up their future and maybe get them into a you know a little Jewish preschool now uh or whatever is going on because you know they they need that so there's all these things come into the mix but they want to give because the culture is we Barnabas gave everything so what if we did this what if we just said it's everything like after all nobody knows what we got for the property after all nobody Safara nobody knows what we make we just call it a tithe sorry I flipped into modern let me get back to the story like nobody knows what we got for the prop we could literally get the teeth fixed we could definitely lock in the kids potential kids future we could we could definitely do a little vacation good vacation because it's and we just bring something to the church and say it was all of it see this is this is the situation now what's fascinating is the Bible goes on to say that if he had have said it's just we had sold a pro we sold a property we made a prophet and we're going to give half to the church that would have actually been Noble but because he said oh no no this is this is all of it look how we're we're we're in the culture but they're not really part of the culture they were bringing the world's corrupt culture into the church culture which was honest generosity and transparency before the Lord they died I want to argue that they held back because they were afraid out of all the reasons they could have held back I'm just suggesting a few reasons but the real reason is they were afraid they were afraid to fully trust God the only reason you hold back from God is because you're actually afraid to fully trust God I'mma tell you I'm going to tell you like it is the reason we are we don't fully trust go it's like giving God one hand cuz they were in the community with one hand but they still had one hand on the world they still had one hand on trusting God but one hand on trusting themselves this is what it looks like when you fully trust God it's a two-hand hold it's not like I'm built upon the rock with one foot and built upon the sand with one foot I'm I'm built fully upon the rock or I'm not fear will hold you back fear will cause you to trust anything but God fear will get you to make sure that you've got you even though you're going to present like I'm a I am a Bible believing I'm a trusting God kind of Kingdom person but I've got my Nest Egg that's my real security I'm having so much fun today and but you know the only way to get rid of fear is with fear the way to get rid of fear is with fear I want to show you maybe with with with David because David talks about this in Psalm 34 see in Psalm 34 we have David and David kicks out this little Psalm or Sonet I'm not exactly sure which one it is but he says I prayed to the Lord and he answered me and he freed me from all my fears now now if anybody knows fear David knows fear David faced off with lions David faced off with giants David was consistently pursued by his enemies like he was pressed by his enemies David had reason to be afraid but then he goes on to say this in verse S he says for the angel of the Lord is a God he surrounds and defends all who fear Him taste and see that the Lord is good oh the joys of those who take refuge in him fear the lord you his godly people for those who fear him will have all that they need even strong even strong Young Lions sometimes go hungry but those who trust in the Lord will lack no good thing come my children listen to me I will teach you to fear the lord David realized that you can only dispel Fear With Fear another way to understand the fear of the Lord is to trust in the Lord that only there's two types of fear there is fear in the world or there is the fear of the Lord which is allwe reverence and wonder it's the fear of the Lord it's it's a humbling fear it's it's a it's a fear that if you here's here's what I would say the opposite to fear is actually familiarity you're like hey well I was always taught that the opposite of fear is Faith No no no you can still be afraid while you're having faith the opposite of fear of the Lord is familiarity when you become too familiar with something when you when you become too familiar with somebody now I'm not talking about that I don't know God because Paul said I want to know Christ he said that I'm not talking about knowing god knowing his heart knowing his purpose I'm talking about treating him as casual familiar this is toxic to your Christianity this is also toxic to your marriage when you start treating your spouse as familiar not as the love of your life and the pursuit of your life and the one that you want to live for and provide for it's the same with God that's what religion is by the way religion is devotion without heart so when you actually start to live religious you actually do a Christian routine it's actually a Christian rigor moral that's what it is you're just going through the motions but there's no heart connection that's why you can stand and worship and people got their hands up te streaming down their face getting completely messed up and wrecked by the presence of God and you're like I wonder what's for lunch cuz you're in danger of a religious routine but where you live religious you're meant to live devoted that I have a habit and I have a pattern but my heart's connected to it I'm coming with a devotion in my life Jesus even said that a prophet can do no good thing in his hometown meaning that Jesus in his hometown isn't this crazy Jesus who performed Mighty Miracles Jesus who raised Lazarus from the dead who opened blind eyes opened deaf ears caused crippled people to walk Jesus could do nothing in his hometown because they didn't see Jesus as Savior they saw him Jesus as the carpenter son it wasn't that Jesus was any different but it's their perspective of Jesus I'm telling you when you get familiar with God it's your you're in danger of treating Jesus as casual and you wonder why I can't sense his presence you you wonder why I feel that there's no potency has Jesus changed oh he's the same yesterday today and forever no no no my my perspective got familiar are you with me here you're going real quiet I don't know why you would go quiet in this section it's it's fear it's fear adanas and Safar they had the wrong fear they had the fear of man the fear of lack the fear of going without you know where you la the fear of God is where you'll find the fear of man that's tweetable where you find or where you lack the fear of God in your life is the place where you'll find the fear of man because when you stop fearing the Lord you start fearing what men think when you have that ananas and Safar moment say wow this is a lot I could give it a God but but man I don't know if people would I don't know if we'd be safe I don't know if we'd be able to mix it with our friends I don't know if we'd be able to go on that vacation I don't know if we'd be able to get that car all these things are what happens and you become afraid of what man thinks rather than knowing what god wow God thinks more concerned with what society says or people think than honoring the Lord regardless of how it looks to the world Anan and Safara they had the the wrong the wrong fear and as a result God killed them Bible this ain't my narrative this the Bible straight up Bible now before you get upset with me because this doesn't just really jive with your idea of God because to you God is nice I don't want to break your heart but I want to break your perception God is not nice he's kind they're different kindness is a fruit of the spirit niceness is weakness oh oh man that's going to get isolated and put on YouTube a nice parent doesn't discipline a kind parent does I thought the parents would show me some love you know those nice parents like oh we don't we do gentle parenting so nice Johnny Johnny don't hit your mother be nice Johnny gentle parenting so nice of you not very kind because Johnny's not one bit intimidated by the repercussions of hitting his mother don't be surprised when he hits a woman when he's dating her and she doesn't do what he wants to do doesn't cook the meal that he wants to to cook no kindness says hey son I'm going to smack you for that son I'm going to discipline you for that and you don't believe me let me take you to some scripture there my vindications Hebrews chap 12 says in verse 5 if you would fasten your seat bels and go on a journey with me I want to show you how kind God is in verse 5 of Hebrews 12 it says and have you forgotten check this out the encouraging words God spoke to you as his children all right you ready for the encouragement of the Lord are you ready my child don't make light of the Lord's discipline who and don't give up when he corrects you for the Lord disciplines those he loves and he punishes each one he accepts as his child it's about to get heavier as you endure this Divine discipline remember that God is treating you as his own children whoever heard of a child who is never disciplined by its father if God doesn't discipline you as he does all of his children it means that you are illegitimate and you are not really his children at all since we respected our Earthly fathers who disciplined us shouldn't we submit even more to the discipline of the father of our spirits and live forever for our Earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years doing the best they knew how shout out to the dads but God's discipline is always good for us so that we might share in his holiness no discipline is enjoyable while it is happening it's painful but afterward there will be a peaceful Harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way not nice but kind so kind of God so kind of God that he doesn't get us too far down a derailing path where he doesn't discipline us and bring us back into the fold so kind of God that he gives us Grace but before we wreck our life he actually adjusts our life some discipline you know the longer I walk with God the less I can separate the word disciple and discipline literally the word disciple is found in discipline the only difference is [Music] in that's crazy that's crazy English language at its funest that the word you to form yourself as a disciple is found in discipline are you with me that's nuts that's crazy but I can't separate it because the same way that God forms you as a disciple is through discipline having the disciplines to pursue Christ having the disciplines to trust God having the disciplines to rever him to be a true disciple to be a true disciple but can I go back to verse 12 of Hebrews the discipline verse so take a new grip with your tied hands strengthen your weak knees at the end of the encouragement around the fact that God disciplines you the writer of Hebrew says so take a new grip this is interesting language so please pay attention because it's very eerily similar to acts 5 with ananas and Safara come back there real quick with me because when ananas came to his wife Safara with the idea of maybe holding back some of the money what safh should have said to ananas is honey get a grip like all the Godly wives here would say to their husbands where where where it's like we we had this plan we're going to be generous the whole culture of the community is generous we ain't going to be the only ones here not generous we ain't going to just come and grift off the community and consume from the we're going to contribute to the community honey right yes so we're going to sell that field we're going to take it and as soon as he comes and says hey but maybe we should hold some back she should have said honey get a [Music] grip there ain't no way we're not going to fulfill on our vision pledge even if I have to go without some more haird for a while oh too far okay maybe if we have to maybe stop shopping at Whole Foods way too far okay all I'm saying honey is I'm prepared to pay the sacrifices to honor God I ain't prepared to hold back things for me if we've made a commitment we're going to fulfill on the commitment because that's not it's not a commitment to man it's a commitment to God and because I fear the lord and I honor the Lord watch me come through with my commitment I don't fear man I honor the Lord my trust is in him therefore I know that my God Will Make A Way even where there is no way when I got one hand on God and one hand on the world I trust God in part but I trust man in part so what I can be sure of I can be worried when the world's economy goes upside down I should be worried I should be fearful but when my trust is fully on the Lord it doesn't matter what happens my God is for me I have trusted him he will make a way he will provide a [Music] way what she should have said but she didn't and as a result they both died but check out what it says in verse 11 great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened Hebrew says s Get a Grip Anan and Safara they didn't they lost their grip they held not onto God but they held onto their own security and as a result great fear gripped the entire church Hebrews instructs us to get a new grip see this is what Grace does it's the grace of God that allows us to get a grip [Music] again to regrip to reassess the way I've been holding this and not be condemned because I've been holding it wrong or I've been holding it loose but Grace gives us another chance to regrip that when I come into revelation of how I meant to hold this instead of sitting in condemnation because I've been holding it wrong and I've been holding it Loosely now I'm condemned the Bible says there is no condemnation for those who in Christ Jesus but the grace of God lets us regrip it's the grace of God that lets us assess and regrip that I've assessed you know what the grace of God doesn't do it doesn't give you excuse to live loose you know when you talk to people and they're like oh yeah but I'm under grace no that that's the very person that in your mind maybe you don't if you don't have the boldness to say it out loud like I don't I say it in my head I'm like mhm you know those you know those conversations where where you're adjusting some things in their life oh yeah but I'm it's under the grace of God you're like mhm I got like a thousand things I want to say right now just say it in your head cuz it's revealing the Revelation what it's revealing is they nullifying Grace they don't have one revelation of Grace cuz Grace is not your excuse to live loose Grace is your excuse to regrip that when you've seen that you've lived Loosely when you see that I've held this uh Loosely that I could regrip because God's not condemning me for how I've been living but he gets me a fresh start and he says would you take a new grip now that you've seen and you've corrected and you've adjusted grabb a new grip that's Grace that's the grace of God for us to get a new grip on this thing see they didn't fear grip the church they had an opportunity is this really the amount that you got ah nah nah we we said it was but we just got a little freaked out you know because the economy is so crazy right now and there's so much pressure you to live life and to pay rent in the Bay Area and all that kind of stuff nah it's not we we kind of just fell into our own kind of thoughts and safety so we didn't really give at all that would have been an opportunity to regrip but they doubled down yep it's all of it they died the whole time this is happening they are completely unaware that heaven is recording what they're speaking that's crazy the whole time they're having this conversation they are completely unaware that heaven's recording it for you and I do you know how I develop the fear of God it's called a Pentecostal mother anybody have a Pentecostal mother I'm not talking like a Baptist Mom I'm they're nice they I'm talking like a Pentecostal Holy Ghost Spirit-filled mother who will tell you whatever you do Adam remember Jesus is watching that's all she had to say that's what she would say when we leave the house that's when she say when I started driving she said Adam whatever you do be bless in the Lord but remember Jesus is watching that's all my mother would say and I walked everywhere too afraid to do anything because Jesus was literally watching I had an awareness that Heaven record that heaven said I'm not living my life thinking I can sneak one behind Jesus because somehow when Jesus was watching he would tell my mom and Mom would come and say hey Jesus told me what you did I don't know how they had that relationship but I knew straight up Jesus was watching ananas his saf they're having this conversation completely unaware Jesus was watching and I love this about the discipline of the Lord he gives us an opportunity to [Music] regrip you really you really revering me you know what fear will [Music] do fear will cause you to lie but even worse it'll cause you to rely on yourself that's way worse because when I come up against an opposition and all I've got to rely on is me I'm stuck but when I fear the lord and I put my trust in him when I come up against an obstacle I don't have to trust me I trust my Lord that he will make a way Beyond ways that I even know how you know how God does that like he can part oceans and he can make ways through deserts that's what God wants to do in your life the whole reason those stories are in the Old Testament is so that you'll see the pattern of God that he's a way maker that he makes ways where there are no ways so that when you walk with God and you come up against opposition you will find yourself in the place where God Will Make A Way because that's what he loves to do that's why they're in the Bible it's for your ammunition your story so you would see the pattern of our God that he loves to make ways when those who fully trust him don't trust themselves but trust him makes a way [Music] m [Music] [Music]", "going to start a new series today series I felt that was right for this time and I do have to warn you that I am going to bring a strong word today we're living in a Post Easter world that requires some strength to the sermon CU we live a different life now in fact that's the title of the series the life I now live and so I want to maybe set a scripture that's going to kind of be a little complex I don't know how I'm going to do this but plan on teaching you some things today across the globe but to set the framework for what I want to teach would you while you stay standing just grab your Bibles out to Hebrews I want to preach it from a passage of scripture Hebrews chapter 12 more specifically a passage of scripture that is not often preached or at least in my opinion not often enough and I want to go to Hebrews 12 verse 18 check this out it says you have have not come to a physical mountain to a place of flaming fire Darkness Gloom and Whirlwind as the Israelites did at Mount Si for they heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice so terrible that They begged God to stop speaking they staggered back under God's command if even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned to death Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he said I'm terrified and trembling no you have come to Mount Zion to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to countless thousands of Angels in joyful Gathering you have come to the assembly of God's firstborn children whose names are written in heaven you have come to God himself who is the judge over all things you have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect you have come to Jesus the one who mediat the New Covenant between God and people and to the sprinkled blood which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the one who is speaking for if the people of Israel did not Escape when they refuse to listen to Moses the Earthly messenger we will certainly not Escape if we reject the one who speaks to us from heaven and when God spoke from Mount Si his voice shook the Earth but now he makes another promise once again I will shake not only the Earth but the heavens also this means that all of creation will be shaken and removed so that only unshakable things will remain and since we are receiving a kingdom that is unshakable let us be thankful and please God by worship Him worshiping him with holy fear and awe for our how God is a devouring [Music] fire yeah that's a Post Easter scripture right there I want to kick off this series by speaking to you from a sermon I'm entitling today your reverence is revealing your reverence is revealing are you sure you're glad you came out to church two Sundays in a row are you sure all right well as you ready your heart for the word of God would you find maybe three or four people around you that you would consider friends if you don't have any friends would you quickly make some friends give them a high five a handshake and then go ahead and take your seat go for it come on real quick make a friend make a new acquaintance get to know somebody in the family of God go ahead and take your seat amen so coming out of Easter I feel a pastoral d Dy to Shepherd well over the Easter weekend we had hundreds of people all across the globe give uh make a decision to give their lives to Jesus to follow him to make him Lord meaning that they started a brand new life yeah can we congratulate everybody who made a decision last Sunday to follow Jesus congratulations you have been born again that means you no longer just simply born of the flesh but that you have now been born of the spirit which also means you have new life this is essentially what the Apostle Paul describes in his scripture that he writes in uh Galatians 2:20 in Galatians 2:20 if you guys want to put that up he said it's no longer I I've been crucified with Christ there no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me and the life I now live series title I live in the flesh even though I live by faith sorry even though I live in the flesh I live by faith the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me the life I now live this life I now live this what Paul is doing is he's making a very clear distinction between two lives he's saying I've H I have I've had a life pre Christ now I got a life with Christ and the life I now live is lived different there's some difference about this life this new life that we live I believe requires some discipleship and I want to want to spend the next few weeks being your pastoral guide To Living by grace and to do that I want to draw from A peculiar yet undeniably powerful passage here in Hebrews a passage that we will dissect over this series but also a passage that we will find calls us as Christians back to reverence and awe and it's honestly I got to commend you it is so smart of you to come out to church today because I'm going to be setting a foundation that I believe is going to be critical to the rest of this series so well done you but let me ask how did you feel when your new life began was it a big change was it distinct when that new life started I'm specifically talking to parents who have kids now I'm not talking I don't know what you're talking about I'm talking about parenting like like your pre kid life and your kid life andbody know what I'm talking was it dramatic it was for me everything changed I remember before our first born was born we Tera and I we would we would go on evening Sunset bike rides uh-huh yeah and we'd pack champagne sometimes the wine in the evenings we go for bike ride we'd sit by the sunset and sometimes we just turn that into dinner out no plans we just do it whatever came to mind you want to do that we just lived we just lived by our own will then kids came changed everything literally changed our schedules it changed the way we approached every day it changed though our spending habits and our saving habits our spending changed so much that that money wasn't about living it was about surviving but how many people know that when things are born things change so I'm wondering what's changed since you've been born again that was a great segue and you didn't give any clap Applause credit anything nothing no don't give me a token one say worked all week on that this is actually some way what we have in Hebrews you see the writer of Hebrews who remains unknown but not without speculation by the way speaks about a kingdom that cannot be shaken for the purpose of us knowing the kind of worship that is acceptable now whatever you do when we talk about worship don't fall into the mindset of a modern style worship that we do here on Sundays while we sing together clap in unison that is worship by the way but it's not exactly holistically what worship is that the writer of Hebrews is talking about you see to understand worship you have to go back to the old system of worship which was a worship done with sacrifice in order to worship God you had to bring a sacrifice something had to die you had to shed blood and that sacrifice was worship however what we see in the New Covenant isn't that different it's just an elevated worship well what you're going to find in Romans 12 verse2 if you let me read it it will actually reveal verse one what worship is in the New Covenant it says and so dear brothers and sisters I plead with you to give your bodies to God did you see that I I plead you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you let them be a living and holy sacrifice the kind he will find acceptable this is truly the way to worship him so what Paul is articulating is in the old system to worship God required a sacrifice under the New Covenant Post Easter world we are a Living Sacrifice so everything we do in this body is worship to God the way we live the the way we occupy ourselves the way we live our life should be done in such a way to glorify God that's worship are you still staying with me so what the writer of Hebrews is essentially doing is that framing up for us the Saints how to be unshakable how many people think that in the current climate with which we live in to be unshakable would be useful to to to navigate a world that is constantly shaking to navigate some times that are constantly turbulent for you to be steadfast Solid Rock Solid unshakable I believe would be powerful in this post-christian era and what the writer of Hebrews does he writes with this intent but he does it by comparing and contrasting two mountains two mountains that he presents but not only does the writer of Hebrews presents we're going to see this parallel and this contrast all the way through scripture and scripture does it encapsulates what these two mountains represent which is the old Covenant and the New Covenant for instance you have firstly Mount sin Mount Si you might have heard of Mount Si in the Old Testament Mount Si was the place where the people of God gathered as God met with Moses to distill The Ten Commandments it's at Mount Si where God etched in stone The Ten Commandments and all its subsequent laws that ultimately produced a relationship with God between God and his people where they could live in such a way that they would remain in relationship you see it's a crazy setting was the setting of Mount Si where God came to Moses and said hey Moses this is what I want to do I want to make the isra it my very own people I want to carve out of every nation in the earth my very own possession my very own people but for them to live in relationship with me there's going to have to be a set of rules and regulations by by which they live by he says to Moses go and ask the people if they want to do this so Moses does it he goes to the people and he says to the people hey this what God wants to do uh sounds pretty good because what comes with his power his protection his provision um but to get that we're going to have to keep a set of laws and the people say all that you have said we can do do deals on so we have this moment at Mount Si that quite frankly happens to be a terrifying moment because for for this holy law to be established Moses had to set a perimeter around the entire Mountain where nothing could come in contact with the mountain any thing or any person that would come in contact would die it was terrifying I know it sounds exciting but the people were terrified they were absolutely terrified in fact it says that check this out in Exodus 19: 16 it says on the morning of the third day there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud on the mountain and the very loud trumpet blast so that all the people in the camp trembled then Moses brought the people up out of the camp to meet God and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain now Mount Si was wrapped in Smoke because the Lord had descended on it in fire the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln and the whole Mountain trembled greatly next chapter chapter 20: 18 it says now when all the people saw the Thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking the people were afraid and trembled and they stood far off and said Moses you speak to us and we will listen but do not let God speak to us lest we die the people were straight up freaked out they were like Moses we like them when you speak cuz cuz you're like a buffer between us and God but don't let God speak we ain't trying to hear God so don't let God speak we want to hear you now for the old Covenant system of commands to work it had to be revered the only way it was going to work is if they if they obeyed if they revered so what you had with this are you staying with me so far so what you had with this newly set up system of law what coupled with it was a system of consequences that if you did not obey the law you would have to pay the consequences and let me Short Circuit the sermon it's death that was the penalty of not upholding the things that they said all you have said we will do if you don't do it you die and so what we find is that these consequences were there to produce a reverence for the law but it didn't it didn't it it turns out that consequences don't produce real reverence because if I give you a definition for reverence you'll understand why and maybe you could write this down in your sermon notes reverence is deep honor outward ly demonstrated it's not the risk of consequences demonstrated it's deep honor demonstrated however what we saw with Mount Si is a law that was established that produced ultimately a a law that wasn't revered it was a law that was feared straight up de anybody anybody knows somebody's superstitious you know any anybody in your world superstitious yeah I used to work with a I used to work with a guy uh we do we electrical work together and he was so superstitious this guy like I'm talking like like all the superstitions you can think of he wouldn't even walk under a ladder you know and and we're electricians so we had a lot of ladders and I didn't even know this stuff existed but one time we walking we were working in this like little really skinny Alleyway and there was no room but for the ladder to be almost upright and I'm up the ladder and there was something on the other side of the ladder where he wasn't that he needed to get but he just he had this moment where he's like H uh and he decided to walk around the whole building instead of just walking straight under a ladder he called it OCD that's what he called it obsessive compulsive dis I'm telling you there's a lot of superstitions today being labeled OCD because it's based in a fear if I don't do that something bad will happen that was the system of Sinai this was the system of law it was a superstitious law that if I don't do something something something bad is certainly going to take place it was driven by fear consequences that's the setting of Mount Si now let me contrast that with another Mountain mentioned named Mount Zion this is not a physical Mountain but the place of God's presence and the representation of the New Covenant the writer of Hebrews uses Mount Zion to describe the place that we now live as followers of Christ we have essentially left Sinai in its atmosphere I like that atmosphere now we live in Sinai sin is where we live Post Easter post Resurrection because of what Christ has done and because we have received Christ this life I now live is lived in si Zion you know what I'm saying what you've come to is you've come to the city of the Living God because you're a new citizen you're a citizen of Heaven you've come to the assembly of the firstborn children that's you and I who now no matter when we come to Christ we get the first Birthright blessing you have come to God himself not an idol not an image not an outer court but you get to come right into God's presence you don't have to go to a priest who goes in there for you you get to come right into yourself and commun with God you have come to the spirits of the righteous ones now resurrected in heaven this is the Old Testament Saints who ran their race who are now in Zion you have come to Jesus the one who mediates the New Covenant between God and his people out at Mount Si the high priest would be the one to mediate the sacrifice this is really cool because what they would do the high priest they had to they had to mediate the sacrifice if you wanted to come and worship God you wanted to atone for your sins you had to bring a sacrifice but the high priest had to mediate to make sure your sacrifice was acceptable cuz human nature you want to bring like a weak limp you know lamb that you weren't going to use anyway little busted up broken you know run of the litter that you couldn't get any money for it market and you thought oh that's what I'll bring to God I'll TI that and and You' bring that and they try to get away with it but the priest was there to mediate it and say no that's not acceptable because the requirement is a spotless firstborn lamb that's that's that you had to have a lot okay and so it was costly but that's what the that's what the priest did they would mediate to make sure it was acceptable now now what we see with Jesus is he is mediating his own sacrifice so he's not mediating a sacrifice to determine whether it's acceptable he's mediating a sacrifice to ensure that it's applied that you don't just leave the sacrifice on the altar but you take the sacrifice and you apply it to your life cuz what good is a sacrifice not applied what good would Easter and the crucifixion and Resurrection if we walk the same way and there was no change to our life [Music] and he he's mediating the application not the acceptance he is the accepted perfect pleasing sacrifice once and for all mankind Mount Si these two mountains Mount Si and Mount Zion Mount Si with sacrifices in fact I love what the writer of Hebrews says it says the sacrifice is still speaking of Jesus it's just it's just cool all the Bible nerds in the place you're going to love this I Haven got time to preach it but maybe we'll do a little bonus track or something like that but it's just so cool because it says the sprinkled blood of Jesus is speaking louder than the shed blood of Abel someone put that in a song come on that's sick you know because you got Abel's blood that's screaming for vengeance but you got Jesus sprinkled blood that's speaking forgiveness and mercy and it's just it's just cool just really cool no other way to say it's just really cool you can preach on that but Mount Si speaks of consequences Mount Zion speaks of convictions you got to see the contrast and this is what it looks like to live Post Easter Mount Z is a New Covenant that's no longer about consequences but a covenant that's now carried in our convictions a covenant that isn't carried or driven by fear of death any longer but a but a covenant that's carried or in reverence that's carried with a fear of God not a fear of death can I quickly talk to you about the fear of God for a moment because can I is that okay okay sometimes I don't know if you think it's rhetorical I'm legitimately asking you would would you like to know about the fear of God because I'm not talking about I'm not talking about the being afraid of God that's sin as Sinai they they backed up when God spoke they didn't draw near when God spoke they backed up they said no no no no Moses you speak don't let God speak they were afraid of death that's being afraid of God fear of the Lord is the ultimate way that a Christian can live a fulfilled life is through the fear of the Lord now I'm not I mean I I mean it in this way and I want to make sure this gets into your spirit I'm talking about fear of God in the realm of convictions and reverence if I can put it the simplest way way the fear of God is our new motivation as New Covenant Christians the scary truth is you can love God but not fear him I'm sure many Christians love God no doubt I love God you're here because you love God and there's so much to love about God he's done a lot for us I mean you just think of all the things that God has done the ways he's blessed you the fact that he gave up his life so that you can live so you get off scotf free you don't have to pay for the sin you don't have to pay for the penalty he's given you Grace I love that about Jesus I also love the Community of Faith that he's brought me to I love the blessings that I get to enjoy every day I love the wife that he's given me the kids that he's given I love Jesus but love loving God is based on what he has done fearing God is about what you do so I can love God but be absence of the fear of God Paul says it this way let me reread Galatians 2:20 for us but I'm going to give it some extra context if that's okay with you he says I have been crucified with Christ uhhuh it's no longer I who live right the Christ who lives in me got it the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith and the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so what he's saying is now that I'm born again Christ is living in me and things have changed all right I'm not living like I used to though I'm still living in the flesh because I feel like I'm still living in a a Sinai world I actually live it by faith because of what he did I'm actually living in a Zion world are you with me now check out the next verse that isn't often preached in connection but is arguably just as important verse 21 he says I do not nullify the grace of God for if righteousness were through the law then Christ died for no purpose the New Living Translation puts it this way it says I do not treat the grace of God as meaningless why would he write that well because under New Covenant living it's a very real possibility it is a very real possibility that as a New Covenant Christian being saved by grace through faith that you would go about your life nullifying Grace is this a strong word you still cool with it you can still have hang for a bit it's going to get it's going to get a little heavier but don't worry then it's going to get real light and then you're going to almost end encouraged but go with me on the journey we could treat as meaningless the grace that saved us I mean let's think about it let's think about it like this the law of sin for the law to work it required the strictest obedience to the law it it because it had consequences like if you didn't do exactly what it said down to the detail the the consequences were were clear but under grace it actually removes consequences because now God gives us the ability to carry convictions okay I don't want this to hurt your brain but I want I want you to process this as deeply as you Poss can so to understand that in the life I now live when I fail to develop convictions is when I actually nullify or treat as meaningless the grace of God told you it's going to get heavier let's think about it this way imagine if we still lived under the old Covenant and Mount Si okay put yourself in this world in Mount Si World there was some mandatory things that you had to do as an old Covenant person so first and foremost let me just cherry pick a couple of them that would apply to today there was a mandatory 21% tax on everything that you earned 21% tenth of the tithe plus all the different offerings that came throughout the year added up to about 21% of your giving that wasn't suggested it was required you had audits on your personal finance and business that mandated that you gave 21% out of your finances to uh to to Israel now at the end of the day it wasn't just that you had to mandatory attendance at every single worship Gathering like everyone they would inspect the tents to make sure no one remained in the camp when they went out to Worship the Lord that means that there was a pastor that would come around your house on Sunday morning just making sure that he's not still in your slippers in your night gown saying oh you're not coming to church to today okay that'll be one lamb thank you it was it was there was consequences so it was mandated now you think about what that looks like when everyone's giving to the to the uh to the priests and everyone is attending that looks like reverence that looks so reverent 100% attendance like all givings taken care of not financial problems like wow that looks reverent but it's fake it appears reverent but it's forced because if you don't do it there were consequences now come back to New Covenant living with Grace at Mount Zion God graciously allows us to be driven by conviction not consequence for the sake of real reverence Jesus loves real stuff Jesus loves real relationship he loves real reverence that's why he gives you a real decision it's not a fced obedience but because I genuinely am grateful for the grace that God showered on me as a result in this life I now live I'mma formulate some convictions I'm going to gather with the Saints because I'm a part of the body of Christ I'm going to honor God with the tied the first tenth of my income because I recognize everything I have comes from him even turning up to church on time is a matter of conviction even though it ain't convenient however in the modern church we have a we have a problem we we have a problem we we we're nullifying the grace of God with casual convictions I warned you I said it's going to get heavier but it's you want it even more oh some people are egging me on like okay the level of your reverence reveals the depth of your revelation of God's grace let me say that again the level of your reverence reveals the depth of your revelation of God's grace I I remember coming under Fire for a social media quote I put out and when I say fire is there a little bit of mild heat you know maybe one or two one or two haters uh but I like to dramat dramatize things um but this was this was the quote I put on social media a couple years ago Comfort is a caner to Christianity causing casual convictions do you know that the comfort that we experience in our church settings lends towards a casual approach to the convictions around things of God you know because there's no one really opposing you coming to the house of God we we can treat it as casual and we treat as flipping like like like because like what's what's tempting even on a weekend and obviously I ain't preaching to anybody right now because you came to church so just breathe all right some of you holding your breath just breathe it's not you for some people not you but some people you know they look at a day like today where it's sunny and they say well we haven't had Sun for a minute and Sun's nice I need Vitamin D actually my whole family needs vitamin D I think we're going to worship God in the sun with vitamin D in our bodies and get ready because there's been some sickness and we that's what I'm describing we nullify the grace of God with weak casual convictions something else I put on social media this week I loved it from The Scholar Warren wisby I put out there a quote from him the reason we don't think about heaven is we have it too good on Earth and that's not talking about thinking about heaven like you know the Pearly Gates and the gold streets or whatever your image of Heaven is with everyone's got little wings that they grow out of their back I don't know what your image of Heaven is that's not what it's talking about it's talking about Heaven's mandate it's talking about Heaven's commission it's talking about living in this world but with a purpose to populate heaven on Earth we don't think about it because life is so comfortable that we're consumed by it yeah can I be blunt with you as if I haven't just refreshing for me to get permission every summer we see a major slump in giving in our church every summer we're doing it for 11 now every summer the finance team freak out because and and it's taken me a while but I figured it out 11 years I figured out that people go on vacation in summer I know I'm smart I'm slow but I'm steadfast I realize everyone goes on summer vacation and don't get me wrong I love vacation I'm all I'm all for it I am the biggest proponent of developing rhythms of rest and going on vacation but what I realize is that Christians take their tithe with them so it's not really a tithe but a tip or an entrance fee to the club that you attend and if I'm not attending I'm not giving that's consequential that's old mindset it's not a conviction that regardless of where I am I'm giving my tent to God's house and I'm establishing it as a firm foundation that cannot be shaken no matter if I've got a down payment to make you know some people have got a a deeper commitment and convi conviction to their bank that they ain't never met you never met the bank manager but you wouldn't miss a mortgage payment why because there's consequences with that Sinai has the appearance of reverence it looks like you are reverent with your mortgage payments because you are meticulous to make sure you make them because if you don't make them there's consequences but when it comes to God's house we which actually has blessed you and God has done so much for your family and all that the Lord is it's so easy to get weak on that conviction cuz there ain't really any consequences for that welcome to Post Easter while while there's not necessarily and I could go on and on about all the different ways that we skip out on blessing the Lord and developing consequences we're ultimately nullifying Grace We're ultimately nullifying Grace now kind be very clear in something and and don't worry this is going to be encouraging this is where it gets more encouraging okay well there may be no consequences in Zion there most certainly are rewards for developing deep convictions can I reveal them to you today you see the writer of Hebrews he he comes in with some well it's a strong warning let's just say this verse 25 saying be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the one who is speaking this is Jesus by the way but more more than anything else the sacrifice is still speaking meaning God's Gift of Grace is not meant to be muted or ignored or used as an excuse not to live reverent in life now how would I mute the voice of God like they did at Mount Si saying we don't want to hear God you wouldn't think we would do that in a Zion setting but what we're doing is by saying oh no a grace of God as an excuse not to have convicted lives by saying oh it's by the grace of go we we're actually misappropriating Grace it's not Grace that gets us out of doing things it's by his grace that I go deeper into things are you with me so when I use Grace in the wrong context I'm actually muting and not listening to the voice of the one whose sacrifice is still speaking okay so he says do not do not close your ear do not refuse to listen to the one who's still speaking check it out he goes on to explain for if the people of Israel did not Escape when they refused to listen to Moses the Earthly messenger we will certainly not Escape if we reject the one who speaks to us from heaven when God spoke to mount uh when God spoke from Mount Si his voice shook the Earth but now he makes another promise once again I'm a shake not only the Earth I'm a shake the heavens also this means that all of creation will be shaken and removed so that only unshakable things will remain there is a shaking coming the Bible actually talks about about it a lot if you read the Bible you know Jesus said that he's going to separate the wheat from the cha and the sheep from the goats the Bible has this time and time again as a warning as an as an illustration to let you know there's a shaken coming but what the writer of Hebrews does say hey things are going to be shaken I'd say it's already here by the way but things are going to be shaken and when the shaking comes unshakable things are going to be shaken loose but the unshakable things will be steadfast and will remain now now I got to help you out because my goal is a my job as a pastor is to make you unshakable so when the shaking of Life comes that you don't get shaken like the things of the world but you stand strong in your deep convictions and you are stable being anchored and steadfast and standing the time of opposition and the truth of the matter is what creates an unshakable believer is a deep conviction a conviction is like a root that the deeper your conviction the stronger your root system in to making sure that you are steadfast in the time of the storm that when the storm is Raging and when the world is shaking that even though things are bending and cowering and buckling and losing their minds you as a Believer are steadfast because your convictions are so deep that they drilled down not into a shaky surface not into the sand but they're built upon the rock of Jesus Christ therefore they're stable therefore they they're stable and that's what it that's what a deep conviction does it sets roots for your soul remember what reverence is it's deep honor demonstrated all right so how how do I demonstrate an internal conviction well it's your reverence your reverence is what reveals your convictions to a world still stuck at Sinai it's your it's your reverence the way that you live your reverence for God's house through consistent not periodic consistent attendance to God's house shows a world not that you're crazy but that you're convicted I mean it might look crazy let's be honest might look crazy to a world where they're spending sunay a sunny Sunday getting vitamin D but you're indoors worshiping Jesus it may seem crazy but after a while it looks con convicted like you must have a conviction about that you mean there's no consequences like you could choose not to go but you choose to go like it's a conviction huh maybe I should go are you with me oh you you you take a tenth of your income and you give the first tenth of everything you make to the Lord in a Silicon Valley environment in this economy it looks crazy but consistently it's conviction how can you do that because my faith isn't in an economy my faith isn't in a in anything but the fact that my Lord has provided for me and I know that he keeps me and so I'm going to honor him for what he's done you know what weak giving preaching is weak giving preaching is hey you give to God and he'll Bless you that's weak giving preaching it's poor giving preaching there are blessings attached to giving but if you're preaching about the blessing alone you're missing the conviction and the reverence of saying God has already blessed me what he's already done let me honor God because that's a conviction in my life that when there's job loss or layoffs or economy downturns when everyone else is freaking out I'm steadfast because God's provided for me before I've honored him with my tithe he'll provide for me again I'm shakable I'm unshakable your your reverence is what honors the Lord your reverence is revealing and reverence is what reveals that you built upon the rock that is unshakable where's my worship team I'm going to go way out of time if you don't come back and keep me accountable I feel like a permission slip when they not up here I can keep preaching your reverence your reverence is revealing your reverence is what reveals what your life is geared towards your reverence your reverence your your reverence is your convictions on display that's what reverence is reverence isn't a monk in a monastery not speaking to somebody not wanting to lift their voice CU I'm reverent reverence isn't volume reverence is Activity thank you Vox Jen leadership team just speak to the Jesus Freaks for a moment cuz sometimes we misunderstand reverence as if reverence is silence or lack of passion I'm I'm reverent that's not reverence reverence is activity reverence is identity when you identify God my wife's strong on this stuff I'm tell telling you she don't give my my daughters a quarter I'm telling you like if they even say OMG she's like no we don't say that I'm going say oh my God no because what you really mean is wow it's not in the same category Reserve oh my God for when you're standing before God in all his Splendor in heaven with the angels at the end of days but the fact that you got a bonus in your paycheck say wow the fact you saw something cool on Instagram say wow not OMG I love that because it's IR reverence he is Holy he is God he is high above he is far above let my language and my lifestyle match it with a reverence and a conviction so that everyone around me would know that I'm either crazy or I'm convicted that I'm either crazy or I'm convicted I don't live in Sinai anymore I'm in Zion and my reverence is revealing this is what makes me unshakable because I've drilled down on some deep convictions I've anchored myself in God's presence I don't treat the grace of God as meaningless I don't take it as a free ride and saying wow now I just get out of my debt I get out of my sin I don't have the pay the price for the penalty that was paid for me woohoo I'm just going to live my life the way I want no I take it as a high price that was paid for me and I say as a result of the price that you paid for me watch me live my life in such a way that has a deep drill down conviction I am going to live a life that honors God that models Christ that actually has deeper convictions than the world could throw at me I'm not going to let the Sinai life of consequences be more convicted than the Zion life as the freedom of God's grace [Music]", "hey Welcome to our YouTube channel I'm so glad that you found us and I'm sure that each and every message you're going to find on here is going to bless your live here we are in our new series called Christ Alone we're really focusing on Jesus we head into Easter and I really believe that this message is going to be clear and bring Clarity to your life so lean in Get Ready Get Ready To encounter God as you hear this message God bless Philippians chapter 3 I'm going to go ahead and just read right from the beginning this is the text I have selected for the Easter message and it might be a peculiar text it's not found in the gospels this is one of the Epistles from Paul who writes to the church in Philippi he says whatever happens might brothers and sisters rejoice in the Lord I never get tired of telling you these things and I do it to safeguard your faith watch out for those dogs those people who do evil the mutilators who say You must be circumcised to be saved for we who worship by the spirit of God are the ones who are truly circumcised we rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us we put no confidence in human effort though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could indeed if others have reason for confidence in their own efforts I have even more I was circumcised when I was 8 days old I'm a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of The Tribe of Benjamin a real one if there ever was one of I was a member of the Pharisees who demanded the strict Disobedience to the Jewish law I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church and as for righteousness I obeyed the law without fault the Apostle Paul here is giving a laundry list or a resume of why he deserves to be accounted for being righteous all his own personal accreditations all his own reasons why he thinks he could cut it as more righteous than you then he says I once thought these things were valuable but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done yes everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for his sake I have discarded everything else counting it all as garbage so that I could gain Christ and become one with him I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law rather I become righteous through faith in Christ for God's way of making us right with him depends on faith verse 10 can I read this too I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead I want to suffer with him sharing in his death so that one way or another I'll experience the resurrection from the dead we have an absolutely rich text to dig into on Easter Sunday and I like what Paul says he says I considered it all worthless worthless I thought I'd take my queue from that today and preached you a Resurrection sermon I'm entitling worth it worth it you ready for this all right if you're ready for this I want you to do something I want you to find four or five of the most attractive people you can around you give them a little fist bump an elbow bump or a hug and then take your seat go for it go for it select the most attractive people around you let them know I chose you and then take your your seat amen amen just for the Italians in the room the presence of the Lord is here you know the Bible the Bible's fascin I don't know if you know that I've heard people say the Bible's boring Bible ain't boring you are I find the Bible rather fascinating in fact the longer I live and the more I read it the more clever the more insightful the more thrilling I find the Bible to actually be and what makes it so incredible to me is its ability to locate you and at the same time illuminate to you the way to live that is not necessarily intuitive to you you see the way I want to live life intuitively is different from the way the Bible wants me to live life but yet the Bible is so insightful that it doesn't just tell me how to live life it gives me a pathway that I can walk on and live the life that it's prescribing for me while the Bible is a book if you simply approach the Bible as a book you will is the sacredness of what most certainly is scripture you see even knowing that the structure of the Bible becomes profoundly important to understand what God has for us in our life because what we have here in the Bible is a collection of books we have a series of stories canonized in a concurrent format threading together thousands of years in Generations into One overarching Singular story divided into two halves you have the Old Testament and you have the New Testament and the Old Testament what you're going to find the Old Testament does is it primarily tracks with the people of Israel the New Testament primarily tracks with the church and it follows the journey or the Revelation or the illumination that these two people groups have while the Bible is broken into two Testaments what it's ultimately trying to reveal is actually two covenants two Covenants now if you don't know what a covenant is if Covenant isn't in your everyday vocabulary if you haven't kind of used the word covenant lately let me illuminate what a covenant actually is a covenant is very similar to a commitment but with the weight of a contract so it's not like the loose commitment that you make to your friends like I'll be there at seven but you end up there at 8 it would be like I'm making a covenant I'll be there at seven so when you don't get there at seven they can sue you that's kind of the weight of a covenant it's a binding agreement it's a deep commitment it's a commitment made with a contract to it and this is what God makes with us his people throughout scripture we see that he makes covenants with people he makes a covenant with individuals he made a covenant with Abraham he made a covenant with Moses he makes Covenant with David he makes covenants with people and as a people group he made a covenant you have the old Covenant and today what we're celebrating at Easter is a new covenant right A New Covenant a New Covenant that wasn't necessarily pinned with ink and a pen or even etched in stone but a covenant that was made with the shed blood of Jesus sealed by the shed blood and ratified through Resurrection that's the New Covenant if I could simplify it for you the New Covenant is better that's Australian for better better come on would you try it with me better better you speak Australian it's better b t t a better it's better it's better than the old one even though the old one seems better I'll get to that because I want to also illuminate to you what the Bible does is it doesn't just necessarily tell you a whole list of stories what the Bible does is it tracks with certain people follows the Journey of some particular people and I say that for the whole purpose of introducing you to a what I would consider a key Bible character that essentially straddles both covenants a character by the name of Saul Saul in the Bible he shows up at the biblical point in the narrative right as the early church is starting to get traction right as the early church is starting to take off this is where we find our guy Saul Saul was at the season in time after Jesus had already ascended the Holy Spirit has descended and the Holy Spirit has been dispersed amongst the Believers and now the church has taken off it's going the church is Wilding man the church is out here doing Miracles we're seeing signs and we're seeing wonders we're seeing people healed crazy stuff is happening in the church and the church is moving in Revival like we're talking 3,000 people Peter preaches they get saved in one day we see people who are far off from God having their lives trans transformed the church is alive and this is where we see Saul show up Saul who shows up at a critical juncture in Acts chapter 7 at the stoning of Steven you see what was happening as the church was gaining momentum and as the church was moving in power you had the religious leaders and the Pharisees the Jewish leaders who were so nervous they're intimidated they're like we thought we squashed this by Killing Jesus but now it's only got stronger and so they said we're going to try this again we're going to put a stop to it so you had stepen who was out there preaching Jesus and as he was preaching some of the Pharisees got together and they began to Stone him he was the first Marty outside of Jesus now technically I think Saul would argue he didn't actually do anything he didn't throw a stone but Act 7 says that he held the coats of those who threw the stone so he was an accessory to it but but worse than that was he was he was ignited by it he was so ignited by this graphic situation that he went to the religious leaders to plead with them to give him permission to go into all the world arresting anybody of the way and bringing them back to Jerusalem so that they could be executed this is this is Saul bless you saw was OG that still OC old Covenant that's that's what that means he walked with an OC limp that's so cuz he's he's old Covenant guy he's in a New Covenant world but an old Covenant guy he was in a New Covenant era but with an old Covenant mindset and he liked it the reason he was an old Covenant guy because he was good at it like he was he was real good at the old Covenant stuff in fact if you want to know what the old Covenant stuff is the old Covenant was a fair trade Covenant old Covenant was fair it meant if you did that you got this it was fair and we also like Saul love old Covenant stuff we love fair trade a whole economy is built on fair trade that if you la some sneakers you decide how much you want to pay for that and you exchange money for sneakers fair trade there was a system within you that decides that's fair I'm going pay that that's the old Covenant everything was built on a fair trade it was an eye for an eye Covenant that if I did bad I got bad but if I did good I get good that was the fair trade Covenant and for people like Saul who were pretty good at doing things in life they excelled they excelled in the standards of the law they excelled in the in the whole regime of the old Covenant because they thought that they were doing so good however this fair trade Covenant was only ever temporary you see the fair fair trade Covenant came into play because of the original sin in the garden because sin pulled us out of relationship with God God loved people so much that he said you know what I'm going to do I'm going to do the Israelites a solid I'm going to hook them up with a fair trade Covenant because what sin requires is someone to die blood has to be shed however because there really ain't anybody around in the Israelite nation that is actually level where their blood being shed would be actually able to atone for all sin for all kind until Jesus comes to do it in the stop Gap I'm a trade I'm going to create a fair trade Covenant where instead of someone dying something die but it would be limited temporary it would atone for a day so it would be enough to get you offline to your boss as to wait while you are late to work but ain't going to work for Tuesday Tuesday if going to have to drag another lamb out of your fold you have to drag that out and go hey boss uh today I'm late because of traffic okay that's fair but that was the tradeoff that if I did bad I had to do something something had to die and shed blood this is why it was a limited Covenant a limited atonement but only Jesus sacrifice could make us eternally holy Saul liked it because he was pretty darn good at it that's that's the way I can put it he was he was good in fact that's what we got in the passage that we read Paul listing his laundry list or his resume of why he was good check it out let me read it again verse four says though could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could indeed if others had reason for confidence in their own efforts I had more check it out circumcised when I was 8 days old I'm still trying to figure out how these are reflects by the way but anyway they were in the culture a pure-blooded citizen of Israel a member of The Tribe of Benjamin oh real Hebrew none of your fake Hebrews out here that's what he's calling out he's flexing on them some of you like pretend to be Hebrew you're speaking Hebrew but you ain't a real one I'm a real one I'm a real Hebrew I don't know why of the tribe of benjam that's where I am I was a member of the Pharisees who demanded the strictest obedience to Jewish law this was his M Mo up until Acts chapter n now all the Bible nerds are like oh yeah acts n all the Christmas and Easter only visitors like what's acts nine let me go ahead and help you just so you can blend in with the regulars Act chapter 9 we see is called the road to Damascus moment right after Paul with his freshly printed permission slips to go and kill Christians he's on his way permission slips in hand here we go I'm about to kill Christians it's going to be a great day but on the way he's a voice from Heaven [Music] sa sa why are you persecuting me and sa's like who are you Lord I love that I love the Bible who are you Lord he knows who it is see Saul in that moment had his whole world turned upside down because he thought he was keeping the old Covenant he thought his zealousness everything he was doing was achieving righteousness but in that moment he real realized that everything was actually working against God and it's crazy in a peculiar Twist of events this is what I love about the selection process of Jesus by the way Saul is actually the dude that Jesus had his eye on the whole time to take his New Covenant to the Gentiles you see up until this point the New Covenant had only come to the Jews but God had a plan to take it beyond the Jews because many of the Jews will still stay in Old Covenant they wanted to keep the old Covenant because they were good at the old Covenant they love their laws they love their regulations they love their laundry list of dos and don'ts and they will reject anybody who doesn't follow what they do they're not going to be like cool you believe that I believe this they're going to be like no we're going to kill you and so that's what Saul was doing and so Jesus said hey I want to get it Beyond them because they're hard-hearted and stubborn so I need to take it to the Gentiles how many people are thankful that God had a plan for us as well and so he brings the he but but his whole time his plan is sa this dude who's an OC guy he wants to use the OC guy wow for a new see people like this is crazy this is why I cannot write off people in my mind this is why when anytime I think that God can't use them I have to think about Saul because just maybe God has a plan for the purpose of the person that you're writing off all along may maybe you were the person that were written off but thanks be to God who had a greater plan than your history and your past and your greatest mistakes to put you back on a path for his purpose I'm so thankful anybody thankful anybody thankful that God had a plan for you regardless of your decisions and your mistakes uh you might be confused at this point because we're talking about Paul and we're talking about Saul well they're the same guy at this point in the story he's Saul but writing to Philippians he's Paul and God changed many people's names in the Bible but Paul wasn't one of them he changed his own name he did he changed his own name in fact his Paul is his Roman name that he went with simply because Saul his his Hebrew name was so messed up in people's mind that every time he came and he was introduced they're like yo I know about this dude anybody got that past you don't have to raise your hand but just nod your head you know what I'm you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying you used to roll like that and and and people still freaked out every time they meet you you go to hug them like yo bro why so quick man let's chill you know you don't Maybe your name it might help help Paul but this is what we have as the guy that Jesus selects in fact if if you want some insight to God's selection style First Corinthians 1 verse 27 will tell you that God chooses the foolish things of this world to confound the wise he loves to do it it says he loves to choose like God gets a kick out of it God gets like this absolute I don't know what gets you excited I don't know what gives you Giggles but God just thinks it's hilarious to take the most Twisted jacked up person and go oh I'm put my anointing on them watch everyone is going to be absolutely mind blown everyone's going to be like no can't use them but watch what God does that's how he loves to choose it's also probably why Jesus selected fishermen to be his disciples because it was confusing to the Pharisees why he didn't choose disciples that were traditionally educated in the Torah and it and it triggered the Pharisees so much they got so annoyed that he he chose the uned because they had everything they had the best edication money could buy and unfortunately he chose fishermen it offended them it offended them but this is also dare I say what for us makes accepting salvation so difficult when you understand that I can't earn it when you understand that I'm not worth it that that's that's real when you think about the sacrifice of Jesus you think about what this weekend entails that he went to the Cross he was brutally murdered he was beaten beyond recognition for our sake and he went into the grave and even though we know he got up out of the Grave I still don't think I'm worth that sacrifice when I think about it I'd rather earn it that's why we like OC old Covenant because old Covenant you earned it everything you got you deserved but with the New Covenant we don't get what we deserve we get better in my summation of myself I have to be honest I'm actually not worth the sacrifice in fact this was a genuine question I got recently we were in Frankfurt Germany we're launching a new campus there in September if you if you didn't know this and I'm very excited about it brand new campus and we're just starting out we're got a team that's forming and we decided last month a couple weeks ago to have an interest night in Germany and we had an interest night at a co-working space super cool co-working space where it was just like an interest night where people could come along and find out information about the style of the church when the church is starting how do they join the team all those kinds of things and as we held in a co-working space we spent some time in the afternoon setting up our banners and making the place look nice and so the people who were working from the co-working space were intrigued and they were asking hey what what was this church about and we said well I mean we could tell you now or you could just stay and find out you know why do the meeting twice you know what I mean efficient and so they said okay cool we'll stay and as we got to the Q&A section of the interest meeting where people generally ask questions about you know what kind of preaching style what kind of music you know uh where will you be located all those kinds of things this one lady puts up a hand and and she says um I have a question who does Jesus love I was caught off God because I was ready prepared to answer questions about the church like when we're going to start and what we need to make it happen but but she she wasn't there for the church she was just working and interested because when I prayed I prayed love I love you Jesus she caught that but she want to know who does Jesus love wow that's a great question in the moment all I could think of was John 1513 which says greater love has no one than this to lay down one's life for one's friends it goes on to say I no longer call you servants I now call you friends and I knew what her next question was going to be her next question that she had ready to go was that's great but who's Jesus friends now in instinctively if you grew up in the church you would know that you are a friend of Jesus but to her defense I could argue along with her that maybe Jesus was talking about his friends because I don't know how I can fit in the friend of God how do I fit in the friend of Jesus the way I think the way I act the way I love surely Jesus was talking about the disciples surely Jesus was talking about the apostles you know the the homies he rolled with well let's for just sake of argument let's consider Jesus as friends have you heard of Judas pretty much the biggest betrayal in history one of Jesus 12 was what about James and John at his most pressure cooker moment when he was under so much pressure he was praying the Bible says that he was praying so much that he was sweating drops of blood in that moment he leans over to his guys for some moral support and they are snoozing true what about Peter Peter arguably one of the closest guys to Jesus now if you want to know anything about Peter just picture your friend who will kill for you anybody got one of those friends and and if you don't have one of those friends get one of those friends I got four or five of them that at one moment I know they'll go to business yeah but that's cool and and Peter's That Guy Peter will murder people for you he was ready to go he had a sword at the moment's notice when malcus came with the to to arrest Jesus he just straight up chopped off his ear and the only reason he chopped off his ear cuz he missed his head that's the only reason by the way church just a bad aim I love the Bible but while Peter is the guy that will kill for you he's not the guy that will die for you because he denied Jesus three times I'm telling you if you think that Jesus is only isolating his friends comment to his friends you are no different from his friends in fact you could be a candidate for a disciple of Jesus you with your messed up jacked up self would be a candidate for who Jesus would consider for one of his disciples and this is who Jesus said that he loves I love my friends I give my life up for my friends none of Jesus friends were worth his sacrifice fam let's be honest none of us are worth his sacrifice and this is what makes salvation so difficult is because I know I'm not worth it so here's a question how do we how do we assess worth this is going to be important for you and the way you walk out your life because in Saul's assessment he his thought is if he could be zealous enough if he could be passionate enough if he could be perfect enough then just maybe he would be enough that's the OC way of worth that if I can earn it then I'll be worth it however in the New Covenant that measurement or assessment of worth doesn't work in fact a few verses oh a few verses later getting a little crazy up here a few verses later we see in John 15:16 Jesus says something so crazy that will adjust any OC mentality people any old Covenant thinkers anybody in here that think that you could somehow earn it even though you're all in a New Covenant world that you still think an old Covenant mindset for anybody who thinks that they still have any part to play in the selection process of God he goes along and say says this in John 15:16 he says you did not choose me I chose you let me get it again you did not choose me I chose you this one sentence actually summarizes the entire New Covenant that you did not it could also read you could not choose me and the reason we did not and could not choose God is because we have been dead in our trespasses dead people don't talk much but because God loved us so much that he chose us and because he chose us we can respond to his choosing generally people clap at that kind of stuff but that's fine it's it's just New Covenant it reveals how Jesus assesses worth it says he he chose you in fact maybe you still don't get it maybe it's still hard to wrap your mind around how did what is it about me that Jesus would choose why would why would Jesus choose me that's a good question recently we had the opportunity to to buy a home when I say recent was a couple years ago now but it's still our new home we're so excited about it we love it but I remember at the time I got so excited because we we got illuminated that this person was going to be selling their home and so it was called an off-market deal and I was pumped about it because I'm like nobody else knows about this like we're the one horse race we're going to just go in and check this house out and so we did we went there with our family and we walked around the house and we talked to the owner and they'll tell us the history of the house and why they have to sell it reluctantly and we're like oh man that sucks for you um and and but we were pumped we were really excited so much so that as we're talking with our our realtor we said I I said how much is it worth because it doesn't come with a listing price when it's off Market I said how much is it worth and she said well that's a that's a weird question I mean it's worth what someone's willing to pay for it that's that's worth and she asked me a question she said how much do you want it I said I want a bad I said I want it so bad she said well what are you willing to pay for it I looked at my wife and said everything all in now I know that's bad sales tactics I know you meant to keep some back negotiate back and forward tell them all the things you notice about the house you're going to have to spend money fixing up so you should take it off the sale price all that kind of stuff I know but I wanted the house so bad I said Hey sir I'm just going to tell you I'm Australian he said what does that mean I said I just I just call it like it is' I'm blunt I said I love the house I really want your house to be my house so I'm just going to be honest with you I'm going to give you my best offer it's all the money we have and if it's not good enough good luck with the next person he said it's good enough for me and he sold us the house friend what's better is this the same way that Jesus it say his worth it's not on the bricks or the mortar it's on who he sees you to be and he says I wanted you so bad I gave everything I didn't leave reserves I didn't send some Angel to do the bidding I went myself I hung myself on the cross because I wanted you so bad I gave everything that's how Jesus assesses worth He says you are worth everything I've got that's the New Covenant that's how Jesus determines worth that's how Jesus approaches us he was willing to pay it all this is why Paul when he had the Damascus moment as he's about with his permission slips about to go and kill Christians and he gets arrested on the road by Jesus it's a crazy story he has this Revelation he says this I once thought these things were valuable but now I consider them worth worthless because of what Christ has done yes everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for his sake I have discarded everything else you've got it up there too everything else counting it all as garbage so that I could gain Christ keep going and become one with him I no longer count on my own righteousness Paul was saying I no longer count on the old Covenant thinking the old old Covenant thinking where I could achieve it where I could do it where I was pretty speaking span and I was almost he's like I'm done with that now even in my best day I had the permission slips I was on my way and now I count that as garbage throughout uh through faith in Christ for God's way of making us right with himself depends on faith it depends on Faith what does that mean it depends on me trusting in God not relying on self some of you are have so much pride in being self-made a't nobody helped me I'm self-made well look how far it's got you what if you actually were God made what if you put your faith not in yourself but you today tried to put your faith in Jesus and see how far he'll take you you might have got yourself here but where God's got for you requires him to get [Applause] involved it takes faith it takes Faith the apostles revealing that the tension between feeling worth it and being worth it the tension between earning salvation or just simply receiving salvation it's grace through faith that's the New Covenant New Covenant is not works it's Grace it can't be earned it's not assessed by what what you've done or what you're doing it's assessed by what he's willing to pay and I love this next verse this this next verse gets me I want my worship team to come back because I got to pray for you in Philippians chapter 3 verse 10 it says I want to know Christ let me just focus in on that sentence I want to know Christ can I quickly teach you something while my worship team gets warmed up can I can I teach you something this word know that Paul uses here I want to know Christ in Greek the word is ginosar ginosar ginosar look at your neighbor tell them it's good to Kosco you that's a good sentence because gonos in the Greek means to know to experience and to understand in fact the same word is used by Mary when the angel of the Lord comes to Mary it says Mary you're going to have a child child's going to be the savior of the world no big deal and Mary says how I don't genosco a man in other words I'm not am married I I don't I have not been intimate with a man I I don't have a husband where we finish each other's sentences and we go to bed at the same time and we wake up at the same I don't I don't know that man she she's saying it in a level of depth that a husband and a wife know each other she's a level of intimacy she said I don't Gusco a man now Paul is saying I want to gsco Christ what he's saying is he's saying I want to know but beyond know Christ I want to know what he knows I want to see what he sees this is what Paul wants to know after knowing everything I tried it my way I tried to earn it I was old Covenant I was pretty good at it but then I realized it's nothing I could earn it's everything he valued but what I want to do now is I want to Gusco that I want to see how he sees me cuz Paul's convinced that if I saw me the way Jesus saw me I would be so confident and so courageous I would never doubt again I would never I would never lack again did you know the Bible why the Bible is so good from cover to cover there is verse after verse explaining the way Jesus sees [Music] you C you're an overcomer he says you know who you are you're a conqueror in fact he says this he says hey I call you my masterpiece my my masterpiece I saw a pretty good sunrise on the way to church this morning it's been raining so much it was so good to see the Sun but as good as the sun is that God created your better [Music] Jesus didn't say you see the sunrise and the sun set that's my masterpiece and then people no he said you you are I want to ganoso that I want to ganoso that I want to ganoso how God sees me so that I might actually walk with a different confidence in life that I might not walk around defeated looking at all my failures and my mistakes and somehow just being satisfied with a certain level in life no no I want to Kosco God I want to know what he sees so that I can walk with the confidence of one who's valued and highly favored and worthwhile worth going to the cross for because he loved me so much that he left heaven for me I want to Gasco that wouldn't that be wild wouldn't that be wild for our minds to understand the mind of Christ CH to understand the way he sees [Music] you", "hey

sake and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body that is the church of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you to make the word of God fully known the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his Saints verse 27 to them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles

your seat Go For It Go For It Go For It Go For It Go For It make someone a best friend real quick and then take your seat in the bleaches in the balcony in Oaktown take your seat amen amen hey let me start with a question and ask have you ever had to defend yourself have you ever had to defend yourself I'm not talking I'm not talking physically defend yourself but if you have good for you but I'm talking I'm talking more about your reputation have you ever had to defend your reputation hold that thought because this week uh we had flon how many people went to floon this week it was an absolutely spectacular conference it was so special to really collect together in a room a a a hybrid of Faith leaders and Industry leaders all together in a beautiful culmination of creativity and collaboration and it was so spectacular because it's never really a space that the church has seemingly historically ventured into a space that has historically kind of been separate that you do the business thing and the church will do the thing but for the church to facilitate an amalgamation of both those things was qu kind of unique and it exceeded All my expectations I I got to speak to some of the most intelligent people I've ever met in my life how do I know they're intelligent because I didn't know what they were talking about I just started to throw in words that they didn't know biblical words just a match you know what I mean you got to bring what you got and I had to had the Bible so I just brought stuff and and and it had no context but it doesn't matter they were looking at up what I was talking about not just me but it was special and it was great but I remember in the leadup because we didn't know who would come we didn't know who would show up I was just out there on my social media promoting this conference inviting everybody and and this one particular person commented on a post and that comment triggered me that that they said they said what does the church know about Innovation come at me like that I I I I I try to play it cool and I try to play calm and I resist the devil when the devil's baiting me but I couldn't help it I went in I went in I I started to talk about how what do you mean what does a church know about Innovation the church is the most Innovative entity on the planet the church started Innovation Innovation exists because God had a plan to innovate the world and bring the church it's his plan for Redemption and I understand that the church has taking a backseat in recent years but guess what that season is over the church is back at the Forefront the church is leading again so if you want to learn Innovation there's no better place to learn Innovation than the church to get the flon then I realized uh they weren't attacking they had a genuine question what does the church like know about Innovation anybody had to defend yourself I felt like I was defending myself so wholly but I was missing the context of what I was trying to defend I I want to suggest and truth be told that Christians have been defending the faith for thousands of years but do we know what we're defending are we defending the right things you see Church critics a no new thing the church has faced critics for Generations church leaders in fact have faced critics none more than I would suggest as Paul the Apostle outside of Jesus you see as Christians we we believe in the Bible would you agree that this is what we build our faith upon it's in the words between these pages that build our doctrine that build our ethos our values our system we are Guided by the text and the word of God we believe that this word actually reveals God in scripture we also believe that whoever reads it gets life life comes from the word of God because it is a life it gives life and and what you got to understand that what we have and what makes up this lifegiving scripture especially in the New Testament outside of the go goels is actually many letters from Paul of which are written in opposition to critics isn't that crazy that the lifegiving scripture that we have that we build upon that we guide Our Lives upon is actually a response to critics to to critics that are trying to corrupt the church that are on assignment what Paul Paul calls them he he's nice he calls them false teachers but they were really enemies of the faith trying to work in all kinds of erroneous ideas that Paul confronts quite vehemently in different sections of scripture in order to defend the purity of the faith and they were bringing in all these extra ideas all these Superfluous and additional things that had nothing to do with the auth authenticity of Christ thinking and suggesting that you can add to Christ but Paul comes pretty strong saying it's Christ alone and he strips everything else away and what you're going to find is that they would even try and use Paul's situation to bring condemnation against Paul they would use the fact that he was in prison as as as a weapon using his incarceration to try and shame him to to devalue him or or to actually somehow render him ineffective as a minister their suggestion or their Hope was if they could discredit Paul because he's in prison then maybe they could deter him and the effect he was having in guiding the church or at least deter him in his calling but how many people know Paul's bad that there ain't no way that you can deter Paul not even prison could deter Paul and Paul comes right back at the enemies of the faith the very ones who thought that they could put shame on Paul for being in prison suggesting that a true Minister could not be in prison well Paul hits them back by saying if you have a hard time understanding that a minister can be in prison you're going to have an impossible time understanding how a savior can go to a cross because the fact that he was in prison was not the problem it was why he was in prison Paul defends well the gospel he saw their tactic and then this is important for for Paul because it was of utmost importance as an apostle that the church knew that instead of being ashamed for his suffering he was in fact rejoicing in suffering for he was suffering for the name of Jesus it wasn't imprison for anything rebellious he was in prison for Jesus for the name of Jesus and the more they tried to Heap on shame the more the Apostle rejoiced for actually being counted worthy of suffering shame for the name this was the badge that he wore shame for the name that that that was a catchphrase that the early Apostles had are you carrying shame for the name it was like a a trophy it was like a badge of honor it was like celebrated at the apostles meeting where they would come together and they would Rejoice you don't believe me check out scripture acts 5:41 it says the apostles left the Sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the name they were literally high-fiving each other they had literally been disgraced and shamed and abused by the religious leaders but they walked out high five and say and broke we've made it in the club they think we're worthy of carrying the name of Jesus they Associated us with Christ yeah they spat in our face yeah they they kicked us out yeah they tried to do us harm but my goodness I made it in the elite club of those who carry shame for the name it was pure rejoicing While others were running weak they were rejoicing because they got to carry shame for the name now let me clarify something they were not rejoicing that Paul was in prison the Bible makes it abundantly clear that as a Christian you should not be an evildoer or a thief can I just make sure you know that we ain't going to celebrate you just for going to prison that's not the kind of prison ministry you know high-fiving that Peter puts it this way and it's interesting that Peter does this 1 Peter 4:15 says if you suffer it should not be as a murderer or a thief or any kind of criminal or even as a meddler I don't know why he added that in it seems like it doesn't fit the others but it's just to include you don't meddle stop your meddling it puts you with a [Laughter] murderer stop meddling however if you suffer as a Christian do not be ashamed but praise God that you bear that name to be a to be a Christian to be a Christian to to be count amongst the Saints to be counted with Christ to be called a Christian which means little Christ or Christlike what a what an honor what an honor to be a a Christian that there's Christ in the label that they put on my life that there's something about me that would be evident of Christ don't be ashamed of that carry that as a badge of honor to be to be worthy to be worthy to be CED amongst those you see I'm pretty sure I know why Paul carried this conviction and why he rejoiced in prison I'm pretty I'm pretty confident that he remembered there was a special Blessing by Jesus that Jesus promises in Matthew 5:1 check this out Jesus said blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me check it out rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven great is your see there is a blessing that is unlocked only when you're persecuted there's a reward Jesus said for those that are persecuted for my name's sake that when you're in a stage of life or you're in a moment or a situation where you stand up for the sake of Christ and you receive persecution you go into an elite category where there is a blessing that is released do you know how blessing works by the way because you know that God is a god of blessing sometimes we misunderstand the way blessing works we have a we have a Jonah perspective you all know about Jonah Jonah was called to go to Nineveh and he didn't want to go to Nineveh because he knew God was a god of blessing so he's like uhuh God I know what's going to happen here if I go to Nineveh and I preach turn or burn you're just G to bless him anyway and so he avoids it he goes the opposite direction but God gets his people where he needs his people and he ends up in Nineveh and he does it he preaches reluctantly turn or burn and all of a sudden he's waiting outside the city for the city to die and smart and then all of a sudden it does and he says see I knew I knew you'd be gracious and he's almost angry that God just blesses people which means he couldn't preach if you don't do this you won't get that and sometimes that's why we don't unlock the blessings because we think that God's just blessing he's not he's not moody he's not up in heaven going well you didn't give this week so I'm not going to bless you no no does it's not how it works see God has already released blessing but blessing is attached to what we do it's unlocked so go it's not like God's in a mood saying well today I don't feel like blessing anybody because you're just all lazy and you ain't really lifting your hands that high no no no no God released we have every spiritual blessing in Christ Jesus so every blessing has been released but when you apply principles like like tithing tithing is a principle that when I apply tithing into my life I actually unlock the blessing that's been made available to me it's the same with the blessing of persecution that when I withstand persecution for his name I unlock a blessing from God there is a reward that is unlocked in my life I can run from it and the blessing is still there but I just don't unlock it in my life I cannot give and I won't see any difference but I will not unlock the blessing that God has for my life this is how God works through principles in his word Paul knew it that's why even in the midst of prison we didn't have the immediate blessings of Freedom he was still rejoicing because he knew he was unlocking a reward that was worthier way more worthy than what he could get in the immediate World a reward reward and that's why that's why Paul had a rock solid hope in the midst of persecution and imprisonment you see this is actually hope week and we are partnering with hope hanger and in preparation I kind of been talking about bringing hope to our communities but I wonder if we actually really know what that is that we have wow I wonder if we when we talk about we're bringing hope to the world do we still categorize the hope that we have the way the world sees hope because the way the world sees hope is it's more of a wishful thinking like cross my fingers I hope that's the that's the world's hope because your hope isn't in anything except the potential of a circumstance change there's no there's no substance to your hope except just if I wish if I blow out the candles and send up a wish if I cross my fingers it's like I I hope the traffic isn't too bad on my commute today I hope that it don't rain this week because I had so much rain I am done with it California show up it's like it's a it's a a Wishful hope but we have what's called a substantial hope it's what Hebrews talks about in Hebrews 611 that says and we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full Assurance of Hope Until the End did you see that you see the world hopes and anticipates Dread you see we anticipate a bright future but the world dreads the future so that's why they hope for the best track with me so they hope for the best in the circumstance like the leftovers at least could it be this you know what I'm saying it's like I hope for the best you know I've been looking in the mirror and and i' been I'm been saying hey car I think I think my my Tide's going out I think the hair's receding so I'm just I'm hoping that I have a nicely shaped head when I finally go bald you know what I mean like that's that's I'm hoping for the best in the situation cuz some things are inevitable that's the way the world hopes I hope for the best but as Believers we hope for the better because we understand that there is a process where God is making us better okay four people believe me I'm going to have to convince the rest of the church I know Oakland bright in it right now they're leaning in they're like Pastor preach they know they know that their future is brighter than the yesterday they know that their tomorrow has blessings that today hasn't even seen I'm not just hoping for the best that there's enough money in Social Security that when I retire I get a sell no no I'm not hoping for the best I'm hoping for better I'm hoping I'm hoping for better I like the way Paul presents it to to the Philippians he he talks about perfection he talks about better as as Perfection and check it out he says this in Philippians 3:12 not that I've already obtained this or I am already perfect but I press on to make it my own because Christ Jesus has made me his own he's like I'm pursuing better I'm I'm I'm striving towards better I know God's got better for me so that's where I'm heading towards James says something similar in James 1:4 it says and let steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete lacking nothing that you may be that means there's the potential for Perfection but you got to pursue it that God is going to make you better I'm not just hoping for the best in the situation I'm hoping for better than I've ever imagined wow this is not just for us as followers of Christ This is for us as the church collectively that collectively we're getting better we used to have a an an an account a Yelp account for the church I'm not sure we might still have it I don't know I've I've us to get rid of it several times just because it's an evil product not the product if you if you if you're yeling a restaurant good for you I I'm grateful you did that because I want to go to the good ones but not the church what a crazy idea that you would critique the bride of Christ ain't going to critique your bride that was your choice don't come up at me with my about my bride you don't get to say anything about my bride I don't think we get to critique his bride either but the kind of critiques that we get uh used to be hilarious like people would talk about the church in this way and the church in that way and I'm like whoa you're rolling up on Jesus and trying to remind Jesus of what he already knows that his bride is not perfect but that's why in Ephesians Paul says that he's coming back for a Perfect Bride so that tells me that he's coming back for a Perfect Bride spotless and without wrinkle and because we're not perfect yet that simply means we must be getting better it simply means that we must be getting better so any critique that you have I welcome it because I know we're not perfect but guess what I'm getting better I know we're not the perfect Church on the planet because you're here I I know that we don't have everything together but guess what we're getting better and we might have sucked this Sunday but next way next Sunday is going to be even better because we're being washed with the word of God we're being cleansed in our mind we're getting some junk out of our lives and we're getting closer to Jesus and because we're closer to Jesus we're getting better getting better getting better I'm not just hoping for the best in the situation I'm I'm I'm praying for better that's where my hope is that God's working in me to make me better in fact this is this is what this is the way that Paul says it in Colossians in verse 27 check it out he says to them God chose can we put verse 27 yeah you're already there good good God chose to make known how great among the gentils are the riches of the glory of this mystery check this sentence out which is Christ in you the hope of glory it's actually a fascinating structure to this sentence Christ in you for all the diligent Believers that came last Sunday as well you would remember that we talked about in Christ how Christ alone but we are in Christ now Paul flips it and says Christ in you and he not just muddling up his words he's being very strategic so that we would unpack exactly what each of those sentences mean what does it mean to be in Christ and what does it mean to have Christ in you well what we learned last week is to be in Christ means I'm counted with Christ I associate with Christ you can find me where the Believers are you can find me practicing what Believers practice and what the Bible instructs Believers to do it's crazy to me how many forums I will find online where Christians argue what the Bible instructs Christians to do but then you want to be different from the world the Bible gives you an instruction manual on how to be different and it's because I'm in Christ that I'm associated with the Christians I ain't going to mock Christians I don't have to agree with every Christian but I but I'm in Christ and I'm going to find my place in Christ and this is what he says he doesn't say that you're just in Christ he says Christ in you you know when we founded Vive church we founded the church on a particular passage that God gave me prophetically for the church it's Ephesians 3:14 to 21 probably one of the most potent sections of scripture that you can meditate on I've memorized it I've meditated on it we've preached on it every single year of church actually sometimes multiple times throughout the year I'll try and weave it into every sermon I can somehow some way because it's at the Bedrock of what we've built the church upon and there's a particular verse in verse 17 where Paul says something fascinating and interesting that really unpacks what it means to have Christ in you it's Ephesians 3:14 he starts out Paul says this when I think of all this I Fall to my knees and I pray to the Father the creator of everything in heaven and on Earth he says I pray that from his glorious unlimited resources he will Empower you within a strength through his Spirit then check this out Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him you see when you place your faith in Jesus the M the Bible makes it very clear that you are united with Christ both in his death and in his resurrection that's Romans 6 by the way if you want to actually do your own study Romans 6 talks about this that you associate with his death therefore you can associate with his life and if you don't want to associate with his death you can't associate with his life that's just for extracurricular Christians in your home time but to be in Christ means I'm connected to Jesus and I'm counted with Jesus however to have Christ in me means I have his power at work in my life changing me to be like Christ to be in Christ is I'm counted with Christ but to have Christ in me means his power is working in me to make me better he's made making me more like Christ he doesn't just come into my heart and say I'll just occupy this no he says I come into your heart and I'm going to change the way you think I'm going to change the way you talk I'm going to change the way you believe and before you know it you're more like Christ than you were yesterday because I'm being daily washed with the word I'm being cleansed with the word I'm being Sanctified and I'm being renewed each and every day so I am I'm getting better I'm getting better this is what Paul was trying to communicate to the church you're you're getting better this is the hope of glory this this is the hope of glory this is what the the world is Longing To See and why we have a substantial hope is because we have someone within us making us better from glory to glory we are being cleansed and grown and developed looking more like Christ so why we are we the hope of the world because when the world sees us they see Christ they see where I used to be and who I used to be and who I am now and it's fascinating used to be messed up always negative Doom and Gloom now maybe not preaching Faith all the time but you're a little more positive it's nice and you used to have every second word was a colorful adjective and now it's every 10th that's nice it's nicer I'm not there yet I'm not perfect don't assume that as Paul says but I'm getting better and let it be hope for you you'll find this pattern reiterated and emphasized throughout the New Testament because it's critical understanding for the purpose of the Christian Life you see to be in Christ means I'm countered with Jesus but to have Christ in me means that Jesus Can Count On Me stay with me this is important to understand to be in Christ means I'm countered with Christ but to have Christ in me is my statement to say God you can count on me this is what Paul said he's like for this thing I am called prison can't even change my calling because I know what's inside me it's Christ working within me and I'm not ashamed of the good news of Jesus Christ I'm not ashamed of the fact that I bear the name of Jesus but you know what is it doesn't matter if hell or high water comes you can count on me cuz Christ is in me this is Galatians by the way Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ it's no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me you know as human nature we have a tendency to elevate self yes yes we do I mean you you've seen it you live in the real world in the social media Centric centered on self world you see it I don't have really time the band are coming up to explain all the ways in which we Center on self and the way we kind of focus our lives on ourselves self-promotion is predominant and preeminent in the world there was a deep desire in our Humanity to be seen and while and while I think that this is not a new phenomena it might be interesting to understand that this is actually dates all the way back to the Old Testament with a character by the name of Nimrod have you heard of nimrod you might have been called a nimrod it's not a compliment because Nimrod was recorded in Genesis as the king of sha and sha was the region where all believe or not the inhab inhabitants of the world had actually lived in Disobedience to God's command in Genesis 9:7 to increase greatly on the earth and multiply it instead the people were assembled in one place they weren't following God's command to spread out and to go into other nations they they found themselves comfortable and Nimrod saw an opportunity to make his name great he rebelled against God and in his man's Wisdom he assembled the people to build a tower the Tower of Babel in order to overthrow God and we know how stupid that idea was and it's interesting that as the tower didn't work the we see exactly after that story we see that tried to make a name for himself through his own accomplishments but directly after that we see the genealogy from Noah's son Shem all the way to Jesus in contrast to Nimrod Nimrod was trying to make a name for himself through accomplishments but God was busy working and making a name for himself through the people who were humble and willing to to be available and use for his service this is what Paul presents in verse 28 of Colossians that says him we Proclaim warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom that we may present everyone mature in Christ this is not about my name it's about him we Proclaim this is what essentially makes Philippians 2:9 so powerful and you've probably heard at a time or two if you've been in church for a week or two after revealing that Jesus himself was humble even under death the Apostle Paul says in Philippians 2:9 therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name so that at that name the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father what what Paul is trying to make sure is established and understood is that it's Christ in you the hope of glory him we Proclaim now now what we find is that the septu has separated the sentences ended with him we Proclaim and started a new sorry started a new sentence with him we Proclaim after closing out talking about in him is the hope of the world but it's one thought it's one thought from the Apostle Paul that the hope of glory is Christ in us and because Christ is in us we don't Proclaim how good we are because we are well aware of where I was when Christ found me and I'm very well aware that it's because of Christ in me that I'm becoming better so I'm not going to give you my name I'm going to give you his name so when people look you and say hey man there's something different about your life you're not going to give them your program of your five steps and use it as a business opportunity to be a life coach can we just stop being life [Music] coaches [Music] can we stop being life coaches I don't even know what that means most of life coaches I've met a divorced or disgruntled or upset trying to teach me how to do life stop you better off just being a Believer and leading people to Jesus [Music] just not giving you 10 steps to how to do life better one step Jesus that's it that's what worked for me and if it worked for me it's going to work for you I was jacked up but now I'm better because of Jesus you are life coaching Jesus you want the next step Jesus there's a third step more Jesus it's all Jesus that's the solution to getting [Music] better well that's a very limited life coaching session yep that's Christ Alone there ain't nothing I can do without Jesus nothing works without Jesus your life will stay the way it is and you can hope for the best but your hope is in the best coming to you I'm going to give you the hack which is Jesus and every single day it doesn't matter if it was a bad day it doesn't matter if you didn't get the deal it doesn't matter if something didn't work out for you or the relationship broke down because even in that Jesus Takes what's negative and he works it in such a way where it becomes building into my body and he's teaching me because he's redeeming everything in my life I'm not training I'm not trying to say that with Jesus everything's blessing I'm not trying to say that with Jesus you never have hardship I ain't trying to preach a false doctrine that because of Jesus the next day is better I'm not saying the day is better I'm saying you're better I'm trying to say that he makes you bad he uses even bad gnarly corrupt situations to work in you that's why he says turn the other cheek because even in a punch I can teach you something even in someone's designed Misfortune that you received I can I can turn it around for good I can I can work something deeper in you now if you don't have Jesus it's just a [Music] punch ain't nothing else it's just abuse but with Jesus's persecution for his name and there's a reward with it grows you I'm getting made [Music] better no", "hey Welcome to our YouTube channel I'm so glad that you found us and I'm sure that each and every message you're going to find on here is going to bless your live here we are in our new series called

want you to stay standing for the reading of God's word and uh I'll let you sit with plenty of time to relax kick back and receive conviction today as you get ready to receive the word of God but I want to stand for the reading of God's word Colossians chapter 1 says this in verse 15 it says he talking about Jesus is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of all creation for by him all things were created in heaven and on Earth visible and invisible whether Thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities all things were created through him and for him he is before all things and in him all things hold together he is the head of the body the church he's the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in everything he might be preeminent for in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether on Earth or in heaven Making Peace by the blood of his cross as a global Community it is my aim as your pastor to get you ready for the Easter season we are about four weeks away from Easter an exciting opportunity for the church to proclaim the cross of Jesus Christ and today I want to I want to take specifically a teaching approach to ensure that we all have a firm theological Foundation when it comes to our understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I want to do that today with a a sermon I'm simply entitling just Jesus just Jesus I want to center around the cross I want to center around the person of Jesus and I can't think of any way to complicate it so I might simplify it and preach just Jesus today are you ready for the word of God you prepare your hearts I want you to do this as you prepare your minds for the word of God I want you to find five of the most attractive people you can find in your immediate vicinity and give them a high five would you do that real quick would you do that give them a compliment by giving them a high five come on Oakland come on San Francisco Mountain View Honolulu Chicago let's go amen amen amen got to be honest with you I'm a little bit excited and giddy it's just hours now before we record our new album and uh I got to I got to be honest I love our album recordings and what we get to do in capturing the presence of God on and on a record and and uh it makes me think think back to the first album that we ever recorded it wasn't with Vive church it was with our youth ministry WG WG stood for weapon generation that's what we called our our youth ministry not because we wanted to weaponize them in that sense but we wanted them to see themselves as weapons in the hand of God my goodness that's good preaching that's a great name weapon generation it was a generation of young people who are Mighty in Warfare and knew their Authority in Christ Jesus and that was the sound of our music as well wasn't it babe we would we would we break strongholds out on campgrounds and deliver kids of all kind of lustful things you know it was amazing time in youth how many people know youth ministry that's what youth ministry is about make them pure in the name of Jesus give them purpose and uh with our album recording believe it or not we we secured an album tour in Indonesia an international album tour our album did really well in Indonesia it didn't do very good in Australia at the time but for some reason we did really good in Southeast Asia and so we had these churches call us and say can we come and do an album too or so excited to take Pastor kie and the team and we went on a little album tour and what I was surprised to experience having never been to Indonesia at the time when we landed just how spiritual Indonesia was like I'm talking about Idols everywhere I mean you'd walk down the street and you have to step over some sacrifice to some kind of God that was putting a blessing or hoping to get a blessing on their business every restaurant every storefront everything was spiritual even from the moment we landed the cab that we got into the cab driver had an idol to all these different gods along the dash had like a little chubby butter on on the front one then there was a cross and there was like some Hindu thing and then there was like rosary beads there was all these different idols and and I couldn't help myself my personality kirat will actually tell me when we go places she says hey honey you going to behave tonight any husbands get that from their wives she'll say uh um honey you going to you're G to what she means is Adam you don't have to challenge everyone and everything you can be cordial you can just let people stay stuck in their mess I'm like I cannot I can't do it and so in this situation we got in the cab and I couldn't do it I had to say it I said sir it looks like you're quite spiritual there and and he began to proceed and tell me about the different things that he prays to and I said wow you you pray a lot uh and he said yeah who do you pray to I said just Jesus now the way he received it wasn't the way I meant it the way I meant it is I'm directing all my prayers to Jesus he kind of scoffed like oh you've only got Jesus what was fascinating to me that in the midst of his paraphernalia he had a cross but he had no conviction there I want to do something at the beginning of our series Christ alone I want to make sure we can Shore up our conviction around what it means to walk a life with Jesus I want to make sure that what we know isn't that we just know about Jesus but we actually know Jesus there's a difference there is a distinct difference in knowing about somebody and actually knowing someone and it's most often often evident in the way that we live our lives in the decision decisions that we make because you can easily be holding on to some religious ideals but lacking the relational conviction that actually keeps you in Christ it's not just going through some religious rituals are you here today it's about actually having a a deep relational conviction that keeps us centered in Christ and the Bible believe it or not is kind of direct with this stuff right the the Bible doesn't just have nice passages yeah the Bible has convicting passages in fact if you haven't read a convicting passage you've stayed in the nice sweet passages there is some there is some heavy stuff in the Bible that I read that I'm like yo like can I show you one real quick this will be caused for some concern for some people today and I want to prepare your hearts I'm about to read something that may concern you it may cause you at the beginning of this sermon to put a lens on your life and to consider that maybe God might be speaking to me me today are you ready for this I got about 70% nods in the audience that's all I need Matthew 7: 211 says not everyone who calls out to me Lord Lord will enter the Kingdom of Heaven that's Bible I didn't make that up only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter on Judgment Day many will say to me Lord Lord we prophesied in your name we cast out demons in your name and perform many miracles in your name but I will reply I never knew you get away from me this is heavy stuff in scripture from Jesus it's not just about what you say it's about what you do so I want to do something today I want to I want to shore up our Salvation as a church I want to for some of you introduce you and for some of you reintroduce you to the person of Jesus in the hope that it may just unlock something for you today that's actually the word that I've been really praying that word unlock as we head into flon this week I've been praying that over flon that there would be we got hundreds of investors and inventors and innovators coming along together to actually gather together and I know they're all going to be leaning into some kind of Revelation that will unlock breakthrough for their company or unlock breakthrough and funding or unlock something but I hate to tell you and I'm going to tell you ahead of time but the greatest unlock probably in the modern history is happened it happened with the Reformation it was an unlock of Revelation around scriptural accuracy that that that revealed Christ not as a commodity in the way that the medieval church had used Christ to control people but but to understand that it was by Christ alone or just Jesus and what that meant in contrast with the burdensome requirements of man-made religion so in that Spirit today I want to reveal Jesus to you yes only Jesus and all of Jesus the starters what we need to do I want you to take notes today this is going to be helpful as you sharing this with your friends and maybe your family for stars we need to reconcile a potential misunderstanding regarding the differential between Jesus as the Son of God and God the Father I've had so many people tell me from time to time oh Pastor I've got a hard time connecting with the idea of God as a father because they have a poor image or relationship with the Earthly father anybody ever heard that like it's just real I got a bad image with my my father so I can't connect with God the Father instead they say I'm going to to stick with Jesus because their idea of Jesus is gentle and kind and maybe Meek and Mild where God to them is angry and full of Wrath well allow me to correct this notion for a moment because as we see in Colossians it says that Jesus is the image of the invisible God right actually going to find something similar if you go to Hebrews chap 1:3 it says he is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature and he upholds the universe by the word of his power so what the Bible is trying to marry up for you is for you to realize that while God is distinct in the godhead there is a clear connection or Unity within the godhead even Jesus himself says in John 149 he says that if you have seen me you have seen the father for I am the father and the father is in me that's what Jesus is saying there's no there's no difference between us that I do what the father does this is what he actually says a little bit later in John 5:19 revealing that the son does nothing on his own he only does what he sees the father doing for what the father does the son also does Jesus is trying to emphasize the fact that even though there is a distinction in the godhead there's Unity that if you've seen me you've seen the father if you've seen the father you've seen me I don't act my own but we act together to outwork the will and God's plan for your Redemption so if you've seen Jesus you're seeing God and Paul seems to articulate it perfectly in verse 19 of our scripture today it says in Jesus all the fullness of God was pleased to to dwell what a what a powerful line that in Jesus all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell what does thatan mean Jesus is fully God Jesus is fully God if at any point today you feel like saying amen feel free if you're a non-verbal Communicator just raise a hand that's acceptable in church by the way that won't be taken as me as you're asking a question it will be taken as me as you just saying amen but I'm non-verbal and that's fine too because I'm preaching straight Bible I'm preaching about Jesus it doesn't get better preaching then preaching about Jesus sure my tone could change or my style could change but the authenticity of the word is straight and adulterated Jesus today you see Jesus came into the world and fully man and completely God to be the champion of our faith enduring hate he was inflicted with pain he took on shame all for our sake known as the Lamb of God becoming the sacrifice for our sins and shouldering the way that we could not bear All Because Of Love a love so rich and so potent and so powerful that he willfully laid down his life so that we could have life this is Jesus and as wild as it all seems It's the very reason as Christians we worship the only one worthy of it did you know this as Christians we we don't give away worship to worthless things we don't divide our worship we don't divvy up our worship to to lifeless Lords and to covering our bases we don't add to Jesus it's just Jesus see this is what it means to be a true Christian is to have a sole focus on the one true king I I know this could be strange to understand because maybe your religious background has taught you to divide your praise that sure Jesus is important but you've got other people that are just as important maybe mother Mary seems to be just as important maybe there's a saint that has done some great works and deserves some of my prayers and some of my praise or or may maybe there's a a past relational figure that has passed and now I need some extra favor in heaven so let me pray to them to intercede for me no no no I got to tell you and I got to correct your thinking that as a Christ follower you have have direct access to Jesus so why would I divert my prayers to anybody else to get to Jesus when I've been given full access to the very throne room of God I can bring my prayer and bring my praise and give it to the one alone that is worthy I ain't about to say that some people aren't worthy of honor the Bible says that but honor is different from prayer I give my prayer to the one who can do something with my prayer this is a wild thought it's crazy that we would reserve and commit and direct all of our worship to one to the one who is truly worthy of it that we wouldn't hedge our bets and have a few extra Idols just in case you see what you miss and I've seen this I've been in I've been in people's homes Christians and it's like there's some latent old Idols from their past that they're like oh no no that's just it's just like you know family air but it's sitting at a place of prominence in your life you see to leave your old life and to follow Christ means I cut off everything from my past and I look only to him that I'm not trying to hedge my bets just in case there's a little blessing somewhere else cuz any praise that I give diffuses the praise that I give to God you see what what we have to understand is by directing all of our unreserved adoration to the one we actually declare that Jesus of all the humans that had ever lived is indeed God In the Flesh and Blood or he isn't what declares Jesus as Lord is your sole focus of Praise In fact it's only by encountering Jesus that you you can ever hope to get a clear picture of God as Paul kind of reveals to the Colossians he he wants them to know that Jesus is both Supreme and Sovereign and in one sentence really a singular sentence he reveals both the supremacy and the sovereignty of Christ in one beautiful articulation it's in verse 17 he says it this way he says he is before all things and in him all things hold together this you're going to be hard pressed to find a better sentence in Scripture that reveals both the suprem and the supremacy and the sovereignty of God Supreme because he's first yes Supreme because he's better Supreme because he is the firstborn of all creation not the firstborn in creation there's a difference he's the firstborn of creation which simply reveals that he is first and of most importance but he's not only before all things he is also Sovereign which means he is over all things he is in control that's who I want to pray to I don't want to pray to somebody who's not in control and total control I don't want to have my prayer praying to some distant deity that just encourages them to to get better now I want to pray to the one who has power to do something about my situation and because God is Sovereign he can do something he is supreme and he is Sovereign a better way to say that is he is the way actually let me correct that he is the only way this is what Jesus himself reveals in John 14:6 saying Jesus said to him I am the way I am the truth and I am the life check out the severity of this no one comes to the father except through me did you get that Jesus wasn't playing and Jesus wasn't doing this to be harsh Jesus wasn't doing this because he was he was somewhat jealous for people's praise saying look I'm the best I'm the only way no no there wasn't any insecurity in Jesus it was the kindness of Jesus to make what was clear that could have been confusing because Jesus didn't want people to get to the end of Eternity and somehow we could blame him for not being clear well I thought that you could have worked through this way or I could I thought you could have worked through this way I thought because my parents had a faith that somehow that Faith would have trickled down to me and I would have been safe but but but he wants to say I could stand in attorney and say you made it very clear that you said you are the way the truth and the life and that no one gets to the father but through [Applause] Jesus see what the world would see as restrictive we see as Christians as clear it's abundantly clear there ain't no confusion Jesus doesn't mix words in the kindness of who he is he makes it so clarifying that there is one way it is Jesus and it's so helpful because I want to make sure that you get this in your spirit cuz cuz I know that what we what we see in the world the wisdom of the world the wisdom of the world wants to do it this way that that maybe there are many ways right the wisdom of the world H wants to project that surely if God is fair he would see the intent that even though you're worshiping a a god with another name the intention is the right see that's the way the world thinks in the world's wisdom the world has a WIS man when anywhere in the Bible does that talk about life being fair the closest thing you're going to get in scripture to fairness is where the Bible says that God Man created man and woman equal that you were created equal so you started equal not that you end equal because you start equal you all start from the same point and everything that God has made available is available to you but it's what you do with what God gives you that determines where you end up are you with me but in the world's wisdom wouldn't it just be nice that what whatever path we pick in life whatever religion we follow whatever near Eastern or modern or Orthodox religion whatever we want to follow will all get us to the same place but Jesus makes it clear Matthew 7 let me show you verse 13 this is heavy I'm preparing you with a little in Matthew 713 it says you can enter God's kingdom only through the narrow gate the Highway to Hell listen to the highway the highway to hell is Broad and its Gates is wide for the many who choose that way but the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult and only few will ever f find it talking about highways you ever been driving behind someone that have that bumper sticker coexist You' seen it it's like all these little different emblems of different religions that make up the word coexist which is a nice thought isn't it but can't we all just get along can't we all just believe what each of us want to believe and hope that that will work out in the end that if you don't disturb me with your beliefs and I won't disturb you with your my beliefs and we can just get along now I'm going to tell you from most religions that will work you believe what you want to believe we all end up at the same place but for Christians yeah come on who know the truth yes that not all those roads lead to the same place those roads lead to bondage and further separation from the truth so we got something in us that when we know the truth we can't hide the truth that's it we can't hide it under a lamp we can't hide it under a bush because we have been filled with the love of Christ we love people enough to tell them the truth so I'm the guy at the party getting agitated when there's like can't we just get along no no I got the truth and it's burning within me and I don't want you to perish I don't want you to die I don't want you to blame me when you get there and you realize that I didn't tell you the truth so I'm going to tell you he's the only way cuz what you want me to do is you want me to be wrong to get along yeah don't work in my life I ain't just going to be wrong to get along I'm going to be truthful in the hope that even in the truth even if you don't like me you'll find Jesus you might not like my Approach but I'm going to do the best I can to model Jesus but the message that I'm trying to bring to you is that it's by Christ Alone that you are saved it's clear it's just Jesus there's no other person that's it there's no other path that can make us right with God it's just Jesus First Timothy 2:5 for there is one God and one mediator who can reconcile God and Humanity the man Christ Jesus scripture is so clear I'm thankful for Clear scripture anybody with me I'm so thankful the scripture isn't ambiguous the scripture isn't playing around and playing metaphors the scripture just comes straight between the ey is like a rock from David sling into Goliath's forehead there is a scripture it's one man one mediator who can reconcile God and Humanity it's the man Christ Jesus salvation cannot come by any other means it cannot be earned salvation relies entirely on the righteousness of Jesus as a sole basis actually I want to do my job real well I committed this series as we lead into Easter that I want to I want to pass to you really really well and make sure that as as a church we can be an army of people that understand who we are in Christ Jesus and I want to make sure this comes through to Mountain View well today to Oakland to San Francisco I want I want to make sure this hits Honolulu and everybody so can we put up my Romans scripture real quick I want to put up Romans chapter 5 verse 17 because this this gets heavy but it gets clear and check it out here it is it says for if because of one man's trespasses death reigned through that one man it's talking about Adam that one man because of sin entered all of humanity we then for therefore carry a sin nature so if that one act of sin was enough to condemn us check out what it says much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ what it's saying is if the one man Adam's sin was enough to condemn us guess what the one man's Grace Jesus who was sinless and perfect can also redeem us let's go to the next Verse 18 therefore as one trespass led to condemnation for all men so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men what is this scripture saying let me summarize it Jesus is enough that's it Jesus is enough you don't know you don't need Jesus and you don't need a prayer to Jesus and a prayer to this thing you don't need Jesus and some paraphernalia from your religious aunt I'm talking to store shop owners you don't need the cat at the front of the store I don't know what it's praying some money you you are praying a curse cuz you're dividing your focus amongst an idol and you're hoping to get from Jesus Jesus said I am the way and is an exclusive way Jesus is enough he is more than enough he is more than you need more than you can hope for more than you can imagine Jesus is enough for all it's good teaching maybe I could say it this way God has nothing else to give H did I say that right I said it how I wrote it God has nothing else to give because in giving Jesus he gave it all Jesus didn't hold something back for when you mature to a new level of revelation that you unlock a new and FastTrack way of praying to some other deity no no he said here's Jesus he is enough Jesus will sacrifice his life and he will suffice every debt that you owe he is a once and for all you don't need to keep coming back with sacrifices his life sacrifice the perfect life is enough for all men for all time all things all man all sins all time no matter what it is no matter what you've done he is enough he is the sustaining sacrifice that is sufficient for your sins he's all he is all he's all and he gave everything because we get all of Jesus God did not send some you know high ranking Angel he he didn't send some someone who would do for an intermediate He sent Jesus and what Jesus did is he didn't just give part he gave it all he gave his life you got to understand that Jesus is all in on you he's Allin on you this is what it means to be in Christ by the way in 1 Corinthians 1:30 it is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus who has become for us wisdom from God that is our righteousness Holiness and Redemption can I tell you what it means to be in Christ to be in Christ means you get all of Jesus and everything that comes with Jesus there are so many Believers that don't even know all that come with Jesus right like like like you don't even you haven't even yet unlocked all the blessings that come with Jesus when Paul is writing to the Ephesian church he writes and he lists kind of like a long list of Treasury items that you now have access to because you're Royal because you're now son and daughter of the most high King everything that Jesus has you have access to and it begins to list these things that most Believers don't even know all the things they get for instance he talks about the fact that we now have every spiritual blessing in Heavenly realms he talks about the joy of being chosen before the foundation of the world he talks about the promise of being made holy and blameless he talks about the Eternal adoption to him himself as Sons he talks about Redemption through his blood and forgiveness of sins he talks about the rich Riches of his grace he talks about the gift of knowing the mystery of God that that pre Christ you were literally blind and you could not see but because of Christ the scales are fallen from your eyes and now you see with Clarity the mystery that God is work working all things together for the glory of God and for the goodness of you he talks about the inheritance in heaven he talks about the Holy Spirit in our hearts as a seal and guarantee Jesus doesn't just redeem you from your past Jesus gives you a bright future with with Abundant Blessings so since Jesus is is enough and since we get all of Jesus when we come to Jesus I need to change the orientation of my question I don't need to ask is Jesus enough I have all of Jesus so the question is does Jesus have all of me it is this is the only valid question you get to us scripture is emphatic that you get all that comes with Jesus Jus the question is have I given all of me have I given or do I have divided attention and divided worship have I added Jesus like a trinket yeah have I added Jesus at as a fails safe prayer in the moments that I need it most but neglect him on that every day so you might not be thinking I worship idols but where do you give your attention where do you give your affection for some of you sport is more of an idol than a little chubby Buddha sitting on a bench I got nothing against Sports love it but my praise will not be for a team that doesn't know my name but for a king who knew my name and bore my name and called my name and called me up out of the grave and into eternal life as Jesus got all of you Jesus held nothing back why would you take hold of God with one hand that's what we're doing yes you might be saying I've got I got a hold of Jesus yeah but it's like that one hand hold exactly it's like I got Jesus here but I'm still holding onto everything else just in case like my cab driver cover my bases heding my BS this is a two-hand hold kind of Faith Church Jesus looks for both hands not in part but Allin that's what Jesus looks for and I want to show you because this is what Paul's talking about for the sake of Christ in Philippians chap 3:7 he says but whatever were gains to me I now consider as a loss for the sake of Christ did you get that Paul is talking about everything pre Christ and now post Christ he said there was a point in time where I had accredited and amassed a lot of recommendations accreditations and reputations I had built a life for myself that would come out of who I'd been and the importance of my life I had a religious regimen that most people would be jealous of I was a man I was a player I was the main thing but now that I found Christ I look at everything that I considered as gain and I see it as loss I'm not holding on to that in Christ I've let go of the past I've grabbed hold of the future with both hands H what is more he says I consider everything a lust because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for whose sake I have lost all things I consider them garbage that I may gain Christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but that which is through faith in Christ the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of Faith check this out he says I want to know Christ I want to I want to know Christ I don't want to just know about him I want to know him I don't want to just know about him in the mix the things that I give my praise to I want to know I want a relationship with him Paul says that I want to know Christ yes to the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings if that's what it takes becoming like him in his death and so somehow attaining to the resurrection from the dead this my friends is the action of surrender yes there's a word for it that we don't use so often it's called consecration can I teach you about that real quick would you take a seat just for a second I got a couple more minutes I got to teach you this consecration we don't use this word so often to consecrate to consecrate but this is what exclusive worship means as consecration we are called to be consecrated which is devoting or or setting apart exclusively for worship and service to God you know when Kier and I got married we we got a lot of wedding gifts cuz we had a lot of friends it ain't a flex it's a fact we were liked and in the midst of the gifts we had someone give us some really nice and expensive like dishes fine china dishes and and and it was cool but but kir did the thing she did straight away she took them and she put them in the top shelf of the cupboard so I couldn't get to them cuz she didn't want to walk down and see me eating my Froot Loops out of These Fine China and we hardly ever used them I we used them like a couple of times under when very very special people came over but what you could have said is that those dishes were consecrated because they were set apart for special use I'm here to tell you that that's what your life looks like with Christ the moment you come into Christ you are consecrated because you are set apart for special service service to the great king you are a consecrated person because your worship is solely and holy to the one who is worthy of your worship you aren't adulterating your worship by giving it out to each and every Lord or deity that's out there that's claiming to be something you are saying my God is the one true God and I will reserve my entire worship to the one king the one Lord the name above all names that at that name every knee shall bow and at that name every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord [Music] n", "hey welcome to the Vive Church podcast I am so glad that you found us I trust that what God brings into your life today through this word is going to bless you expand you and grow you as a result I pray that God equips you I pray that God mobilizes you after hearing this word enjoy so good to be in the house of God with the people

we did ski week I don't know if that's just a California thing or if it's a national thing but it's cool I like it I'm into it we've always heard of it never done it but this week we did Kira switched it up she she's been snowboarding for 20 years and uh and we decided to switch her up to skiing and I'm not knocking her snowboarding ability but she skied better than she snowboard this week this girl's crazy we had a great time catching up with friends just talking about you know how much Vibe churches has grown over the years and the different stages it's gone through and I I heard something I didn't really know about I don't know if you know this but 12 years ago we had a reputation at Vive church and the reputation was we were the skinny jean Church did you know about this you heard about this I didn't know cuz I was wearing the jeans but so were you all right and so hu you definitely were for sure I never seen jeans as skinny as the ones you were wearing that you had great legs for it the but it made me think about the things that we wear that things change over time in fact there was this one time I remember the time not one time the time the only time I asked kir to marry me I had to propose we've been dating for a minute and I thought Now's the Time and I'd prepared myself with every preparation for the proposal I had prepared the transportation I had prepared the restaurant I had prepared my speech I had prepared the ring I prep prepared everything and I told a real James Bond like here's a date time be there and then she said cool what do I wear now I didn't know how to respond I didn't know in my mind I couldn't for the life of me think of any of her outfits that she had want previously men helped me out you know we don't really pay attention to details so I just panicked in the moment and I said don't worry about it I I'll provide an outfit so I went shopping and I didn't know where to start I'm I'm in the women's section for the first time in my life I'm looking around I'm like a lost fa in a Wilderness and I end up seeing this purple suit I'm telling the truth I saw a purple suit and I just said that's it get it buy it done let's go and and and the lady was like this one I said that's the one I got a vision that's the one and I swear to you I bought Kira a purple suit but whatever you're thinking don't think that cuz it was awesome I'm telling you she wore the suit the only thing I didn't plan for is have you ever heard of power dressing you know where you don't just wear your usual clothes you put a suit on and all of a sudden you you're powerful I I went from like excited to propose to intimidated she power dressed she turned up and I'm like oh my goodness I'm a oh man I don't know if she should propose to me or if I should propose to her what if I told you that with the Holy Spirit you could power addess you could actually clothe yourselves with power one of the most exciting elements of the holy spirit that we are yet to cover in this series is the power of the Holy Spirit and as your pastor I have to tell you I'm I'm honestly ly very excited to think of the possibility of what it looks like to have a church who fully understand and comprehend what it looks like to operate in power to operate in the and unlock the power of the Holy Spirit you see something that we established early in this series is that as Believers we have an advantage we've got an advantage over the people of the world who do not have the advantage that we have and the advantage that we have is that we have the advocate the helper or the promise as Jesus J reveals here in Luke 24: 49 he reveals that there is a promise that God has empowered us with to perform miracles to exercise Authority and to operate in our gifts as we expand the kingdom of God each one of those things are very very cool way cooler than you're responding that you have authority to to to to work miracles that you have the power to perform signs and wonders that God God has put something in you that gives you an advantage to the way that you operate to the way that you approach the world to the way that you walk out your day-to-day life you get to walk like an elite person because you have something the world does not have you got power within you you got the kingdom within you at your disposal you have great works and great things now if I was if I was going to explain to you what the power of the the holy spirit is I could start by kind of backtracking all the way through the Old Testament and kind of reveal some different ways in which the holy spirit moveed for instance his power is first seen in creation for it was by the power of the holy spirit that the world came into being Genesis 1:1 it says in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth now the Earth was formless and empty Darkness was over the surface of the deep but check this out and the spirit of God was hovering ing over the waters the Holy Spirit was there at creation Now the Holy Spirit also you'll find if you actually read the Old Testament empowered uh God's people to bring about his will we see it with judges the Holy Spirit would come upon judges to to judge in the orderly way that God wanted things to be judged he would come up upon prophets where they would reveal and illuminate the things of God for the people of God to get direction would come upon Kings who would pass edicts and rules in line with God's plan and to achieve his purpose and you had just ordinary people who were able to perform extraordinary things Divine things because of the empowerment of the holy spirit this is evidently shown in 1st Samuel 16:13 with King David it says so Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers and from that day on the spirit of the Lord Came powerfully Upon David do you see that it says and from that day on the spirit of the Lord Came powerfully Upon David the language is important because we also see this with Samson you all know about Samson I just have to make sure because I've spoken about Samson before just in general reference and someone afterwards said uh Pastor who's Samson and I realized not everyone went to Pentecostal kids church like I did with felt boards and Bible characters all right so I'm going to bring the felt boards back look forward to the felt someday all right look forward to it and uh it's going to be great we're going to learn all the Bible characters Daniel and the Lions then we're going to going to do all of them anyway but in s Samson you'll see that in judges 14:6 it says the spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon Him notice the language in 1st Samuel 16 the spirit of the Lord Came powerfully Upon David in judges 14:6 the spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him so that he tore the line apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young good in fact every story of Samson starts this way it precedes the performance with the revelation of the spirit rested upon him now if we're to fast forward to the New Testament we're actually going to find that Jesus promises the holy spirit's power would help us as his disciples as we spread the word across the world acts 18 it says but you will receive receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you'll be my Witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria all to the ends of the Earth this is because the salvation of every single soul is only made possible through the power of the Holy Spirit I I I I distinctly remember encountering this back when I was just a youth uh youth group leader I wasn't even a youth pastor I wasn't ordained in Ministry I hadn't enrolled in in Bible College yet I was part-time electrician and part-time youth group leader we just taken on this small youth ministry actually reluctantly we took it on reluctantly and and we had had what was called a Citywide youth Gathering where all these youth groups would come together for a bigger youth group and and and in that thing we would you know just have hundreds and there was almost a thousand young people there and very exciting and I remember the day that we were setting up for the event that evening the director of the combined youth Gathering came up to me and said we got to problem I said what's the problem he said uh our speaker is canceled I said that sounds like a you problem he said no no it's a you problem because I spoke last time now it's your turn and I said I haven't prepared a message he said you better get busy now I can honestly tell you I do not remember a single word I spoke I think I blanked out I I really do I can't I tried to go back this was back before we had digital devices this was pen and paper notes scribbles that in my nervous just writing down something that I could remember about the Bible that I'd read and I remember preaching something but I can't remember what I preach but it doesn't matter what I preach because I distinctly remember hundreds of young people coming down to the altar having their life transformed not because of the words I use but because the Holy Spirit took what I did in obedience and panic and made it manifest into a life transformed that's the power of the holy spirit in Salvation in fact let me take things a little bit deeper if that's okay with you do you know that every Miracle Jesus performed was done in the power of the Holy Spirit including Resurrection do you know what I love about Jesus Jesus is so secure that he said even greater things will you do can you think about the security of Jesus for a moment because most of us would be like cool with people doing some things as long as it's not better than the things I'm doing I'm cool with my team preaching up here as long as they don't preach better than me you know the moment they do that send him to London but Jesus he's like hey you've seen the Miracles I've done raising the dead and Healing The Sick healing the blind letting the lame walk hey all that stuff is good but you're going to do better because I'm going to give you the holy spirit so secure is Jes Jesus that he gives us a model to walk in and even exceed what a confident Christ we have and this is because the holy spirit is the power of God the Hol did you get that the holy spirit is not just an Avenue for the power of God the holy spirit is the Manifest power of God where the holy spirit is the presence of God is and where the presence of God his power is sure to be the presence of God is not just a feeling that we get that we go how hey this is enjoy able know the the power of God comes in the presence of God so when you're in the presence of God healing should happen breakthrough should happen Miracles should happen words of knowledge should happen illumination should happen salvation should happen in the presence of God now understanding that the holy spirit is the power of God the next question that we need to ask is how do I access this power in fact there's a story in Acts that illustrates this with a particular character named Simon the Magician and Simon the Magician was a sorcerer he had some special magic skills that he had developed and he was impressing the people he would perform these magic tricks and the people thought he had so much power and they would follow his advice because he would he would impress them with power and then he would give directional advice for their life up until the apostles came and when the apostles showed up they began to operate in real power they would see lame people walk and blind people see and deaf people here everywhere they went there was miraculous even the demons began to flee as the apostles began to pray for people and Simon the Sorcerer looked at their power compared to his power so he rejected his power and followed after them and he was so impressed with the power of God he came to the disciples and said how do I pay for this power how can I buy this power and the apostles rebuked him because the power of God cannot be purchased the power of God is not something that you can just simply pay for the power of God was paid for by Christ and has been made available to you so while you can't purchase it you can put it on you can't put it on it was the blood of Jesus that paid for the power of God to be ex extended to you so now it's your job to Simply put it on because you have it did did you know you have it every believer every person who has Christ in their life has the the potential for power you have the potential because you have the Holy Spirit in you the Bible makes it very clear that if you have Christ you have the Holy Spirit the problem is we forget to put it on I'm going to take you back to Luke 2449 it says I'm going to send you what my father has promised but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high let me fast forward now to Acts chapter 2 where the disciples are waiting for that power and it says and suddenly they came from Heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind and it filled the entire house where they were sitting and divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance we find similar language in Romans 1314 it says but put on the Lord Jesus Christ put on more of this language is found in 1 Corinthians 15:53 for the this perishable body must be put on the imperishable and the Mortal body must put on the immortality Galatians 3:27 for as many of you were baptized into Christ have put on Christ let me give you one more Colossians 3:9 it says do not lie to one another seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and put on the new self do you understand the language of scripture here that there is a process to take what you've got and put it on that there wasn't old you but you put that off but in the process of putting that off have you forgot to put on what's new you got the potential of it the Holy Spirit resides within you if Christ is in you but have you put it on that's what we have in Acts acts is known as The Acts of the Apostles because they acted on the power of the Holy Spirit you got to put on the spirit you have the Holy Spirit so what Romans 8 91 read that in your own time it's emphatically clear that if you have Christ you have the Holy Spirit but have you activated the Holy Spirit have you stepped into your calling have you walked with the Holy Spirit have you outworked what God put in of the Holy Spirit but am I walking through it in fact that's what you're going to find as you as you kind of track through the Gospel of Luke what you're going to find is the Gospel of Luke is a constant has a constant theme of God's provision go whether it's the feeding of the 5,000 and the provision of food or teaching about God's provision in Luke 12 one of the things that God provides us with as his people who are called to do his will is he's provided us with his power he doesn't just call us into a mission and say good luck he gets a purpose on your life and he says let me couple it with some power that's a good God and because God provides us with purpose he provides us with his Spirit which is power with his power so you got a purpose but do you have the power I I I tried something

a little nauseous from those clouds let me um let me go back and let's just get into the Wilderness cuz that's what we're talking about even though you're walking through the Wilderness my God God is with me amen you know what this is like a holy spirit hack right here cuz I could be talking to somebody I could be talking to do cuz I often do and uh and and and I could be sitting there talking to do and just as I'm talking he didn't even know I'm scrolling I'm scrolling and I'm going to find oh yeah yeah let's go let's go to Philippians chapter 4 actually let's go Philippian oh what happened to my here's my hand okay let's go number how come I can't get to number three where are you where'd you go oh there you go okay well let's go to Colossians that works too they great great verses or Thessalonians chapter 2 all right and then I could I could just kind of scroll down and I could pick this and I could be hey do you know what let me encourage you in the Lord 1 Thessalonians chap 2: 19 you know that right I do for what is our hope our joy or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes is it not you indeed you are our glory and joy that's the reason we do this it's for you do that's how you can operate under the power of the Holy Spirit I can go back into the desert and start reading my uh my notes his power is first SE in creation for it was by the power of the holy spirit that the world came into being I have found a hack to life but I'm not trying to promote Apple products I'm trying to promote the holy spirit that as cool as this product is thank you Vance what's way cooler is the Real Life Enhancement of the holy spirit in your life that as I begin to put on the power that's within me I get to operate in such a way like I have my apps up like I have my music like I have my my repeat the promises of God on repeat the Holy Spirit I don't need necessarily a visual Bible every day I got the Holy Spirit reminding me that I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus who cares who's against me if my God is for me what I can do is even in the midst of the chaos I can find the peace that surpasses all understanding because he sets a table for me in the presence of my enemy I don't need to escape to the desert I don't need to escape to the mountains I don't even need to go to the heavens because I'm already a a resident of Heaven because he reminds me that he's with me I just got to put it on see that device holds power the potential but it's when I put it on that I'm transported what if you hold the potential of the Holy Spirit but he's waiting for you to put him on waiting for you to activate him waiting for you to step into the power that you have and begin to lead each day with the power of the Holy Spirit at the Forefront not getting into a situation and going oh where was that power again but to start your day saying today today I'm going to do it different today I'm going to walk in the power of the Holy Spirit today I'm going to actually put you on I'm going to put you on and clothe myself with the power of God so everywhere I go everything I see I see through the filter and the presence of God I see it through a different lens I see it with possibility you're not looking any longer with intimidation you're looking as a Victor who is already overcome because Christ is with me I'm not alone I can walk into any board meeting any setting any pressure situation knowing that the holy spirit is with me cuz I got power I got power would you stand to your [Music] feet", "hey welcome to the Vive Church podcast I am so glad that you found us I trust that what God brings into your life today through this word is going to bless you expand you and grow you as a result I pray that God equips you I pray that God mobilizes you after hearing this word enjoy come on would you turn me to Romans grab your bible out turn me to Romans as we kick off a new series today Holy Spirit school I can't think of a better passage of scripture to go to than Romans 8 the meaty stuff Romans 8 I want to go ahead and read from verse 22 it says for we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the Pains of childbirth until now and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit grown inwardly as we e wait eagerly for adoption as Sons for the Redemption of our bodies for in this hope we were saved now hope that is seen is not hope for who hopes for what he sees but if we hope for what we do not see we wait with the patience likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know what to pray as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words and he who searches Hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the Saints according to the will of God as I mentioned today we're beginning a brand new series called Holy Spirit school it's going to be a teaching series over this teaching series we're going to unpack some different elements of the Holy Spirit we're going to look at the promise of the Holy Spirit we're going to look at the purpose of the Holy Spirit we're going to unpack the power of the Holy Spirit and today I thought we could I could maybe introduce you to the person of the Holy Spirit and if you're so ready and your heart is full of anticipation I want to prepare You by letting you know I'm framing ing this sermon with kind of a a question or maybe a statement which is help me Holy Spirit that's the sermon title today help me Holy Spirit youall ready for this all right find four people real quick give him a high five and then take your seat go for it go for it go for it thank you San Jose San Francisco Oakland Mountain View Chicago Honolulu Rome Mona Milan London and our Frankfurt team amen amen how how many people ask me answer me honestly how many people have a hard time admitting they need help in life anybody have a hard time with that yeah generally the men figures uh like Ben I uh I realized my uh my my wife has no problem asking for help at all I felt it deeply Pastor Ben when you're talking about the fact that you can shut off the lights you can lock up the house you can get yourself into bed and then they have no trou trouble waiting for that very moment to say could you feel my Stanley you know what I mean like that's the I just wouldn't ask that I just wouldn't ask it I just I wouldn't dare ask somebody to go to the inconvenience of hopping out of bed after everything's been I would have timed my requests maybe it's a male thing I don't know maybe it's men we just have a hard time asking for help I realized this real early in our marriage when it was like well brand new marriage married and when we're brand new married we had no money we really didn't own much and we had the only car we had was Kira's car that she had had I think from the first time she started driving and so it had to be repaired all the time in fact it was it was so bad that it broke down like on our way to Honeymoon it broke down and uh and I I spent the next few weeks trying to repair it myself because I didn't want help especially not from her suggestion which was just call my dad that wasn't wasn't going to happen I remember being out there and having no idea what I'm doing by the way I am not a mechanic I would I I had no idea what I was looking for Vu I had the hood open and I was I was in there I'm just looking for things that are loose that's what I was looking for in case something fell out you know what I mean and then you just plug it back in that's my my extent of my knowledge and in fact one time I was out there and I'm just like I'm in I'm I'm trying to feel around and I felt something loose I thought this is it this is this is literally it and I'm I found something that was in there and it's loose it was kind of loose it's wobbling I it's not meant to wobble I might just try and I dislodged it as I pulled it out I realized it was a dead bird staring at me covered in oil no eyes just crusty and I'm like you know when you have one of those fearful moments where you scream but it's a delayed scream and I'm looking at like and I could my hand locked in I'm out in the middle of the street doing this it was that that moment I said let's call your dad he came over fix the Caro problem I thought this is actually pretty good I said hey Dad uh I got some picture frames that need hanging and he did that too from that day forward I began to ask my father-in-law for everything here's my question why don't we do this with the Holy Spirit like once you realize that he helps why don't we ask for help uh since this is Holy Spirit School allow me to take some what I would consider a teaching approach today to start us off while I introduce you to the Holy Spirit I don't want to discount or maybe discredit your personal experience your history your understanding of the Holy Spirit today but for the sake of us all kind of growing together as a global church maybe you would bear with me this morning while I build for all of us a firm foundation by Framing our time together around the question who is the Holy Spirit you see an incorrect approach would be to ask what is the holy spirit because the holy spirit is not a Mist the holy spirit is not a Mystical Force or a mere feeling he is the third person of the Trinity with a specific function and role within the godhead he is he is an actual person by the way the Holy Spirit has a mind of his own the Holy Spirit has a will and the Holy Spirit has emotions this means he thinks this means the Holy Spirit acts he knows and he also decides on his own which gift you and I will receive as we participate in the expansion of the kingdom it is the holy spirit it was Jesus who gave us the mission but it's the Holy Spirit who equips us with what we need specifically within our participation of Kingdom expansion the specific gifts that we need so if there is a gift that you want you can't just ask for it you have to get on Mission so there is a purpose for the gift being given to you you can sit still in your home all day and wish you could sing like Pastor power but ain't going to happen why don't you start to Grace the stage why don't you start to put some training to work why don't you actually start to put yourself out there and give the Holy Spirit a a reason to gift you with the anointing it's how it works it's the Holy Spirit who decides each gift and what gift we get this means that that there is there is hope today there is There's Hope in fact My Hope I hope to trigger some sensitivities every time I take the stage I try to offend just a little bit you know there's no growth without offense that's what I was taught and so I I you know measured the line how much offense you can handle but but but I I do want to inform you that the holy spirit is also a he as Paul reveals in our scripture in Romans it says but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for what this is important to know as we're going to get to know the Holy Spirit specifically his personality in fact what will really help us get to know the holy spirit is actually understanding the array of titles that the Holy Spirit has because the Holy Spirit you will go to find has many different functions that the Holy Spirit operates in many different ways and sometimes if you want to get to know somebody especially someone that you're married to maybe a spouses over time you'll see them many different ways they act the things that they do that make them them the Holy Spirit has a personality that is Iconic to the Holy Spirit though when you see something operate in a certain way yep that's the Holy Spirit you begin to see it you begin to recognize it the instance let me show you the holy spirit is the author of scripture as 2 Timothy chapter 3:16 reveals not not only is all scripture God breathed but it was actually the holy spirit that ignited and inspired each and every author and the minds of the scriptural authors to write what they wrote another name or description for the holy spirit is the Rua or the Breath of God and it was the Rua that was breathed into man at creation giving man life it was the very Breath of God some other descriptions of the Holy Spirit you'll find throughout scripture include the the comforter the counselor the guide the revealer the intercessor the indweller and the deposit he is the spirit of Truth he is the spirit of God he is the spirit of of life and just like Jesus he is a teacher and a witness the Bible reveals in John that he will lead you into all truth that means there are truths of course the Bible is the truth but there are truths even beyond the Bible that the holy spirit will lead you into he will lead you into all truth he is the very spirit of God and this is what Paul wants us to know now while I do not have time on this a ordination Sunday to give you every single scriptural reference regarding the different roles and the titles of the holy spirit let me assure you that the holy spirit is most certainly evident and actually specifically referenced in every single book of the Bible not just the New Testament in fact from book to book what you will find revealed is a specific and different Dynamic of the holy spirit for instance in Genesis we see the holy spirit in creation in Exodus we find the holy spirit in the burning bush in Leviticus the Holy Spirit appears as holy fire in numbers we find the spirit of impartation in Deuteronomy he is revealed as a consuming fire in Joshua we find him breaking down walls in Jud in judges he is the spirit of strength in Ruth he is both fear favor and blessing in 1 Samuel he's oil in second Samuel he's victory in First Kings we see him burn up Elijah's wet wood in Second Kings he restores life through Elijah's dry bones in first Chronicles he anoints the future Generations in 2 Chronicles he Glory his glory fills the house in Ezra he is a shout of joy in Nehemiah he is water for your thirst in Esther he positions you for such a time as this in job he repays double for all of your trouble in Psalms he is the oil of joy and gladness in Ecclesiastes he's with us in all seasons in Song of Songs he's the Banner Over Us in Isaiah he is upon us because he has anointed Us in Jeremiah he is the fire shut up in my bones and Lamentations he renews our days in Ezekiel he revives dry bones in Daniel he shuts the mouths of Li lions in Hosea he's patient with us in Joel he is pulled out on All Flesh in Amos we find that he is the mountains dripping with wine in Obadiah he is the deliverer of Mount Zion In Jonah he is the anointing on the Evangelist in Micah we are full of Power by the holy spirit in naam is great in power in habac he reveals the miraculous work in Zephaniah he restores in Hagi he fills the temple with glory in Zechariah we find out that it's not by might it's not by power it's by his spirit says the Lord in Malachi he opens the windows of blessing in Matthew he is revealed in the baptism of fire in Mark he is the signs following those of us who believe in Luke he is the promise of the father in John he is your helper in Acts he's the display of Pentecostal power in Romans he's the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus in first and 2 Corinthians he's the gift of the spirit in Galatians he's the fruit of the spirit in Ephesians he's the Seal of the spirit confirming us as his in Ephesians he's the peace that surpasses all understanding in Colossians he's the Unseen hand of God in first and second tonians he's the Thessalonians he's the sound of the trumpet in first Timothy he's the gift within you in second Timothy he's the power love and sound mind in Titus he renews and regenerates in phiman he restores the call of God in Hebrews he's the gift of faith in James he's the anointing to heal in first and second and Peter he's the resurrection power in first second third John he's the anointing that abides in you in June he builds you up in your Most Holy Faith and in Revelation he's the river that flows from the throne and from the lamb so if you want to know who the holy spirit is he's all of those things the holy spirit is not reserved just to the day of Pentecost and the outpouring of the disciples he's there at the beginning he's there at the end he's there throughout all generations and he has manifest throughout all scripture that's how you get to know the Holy Spirit to see the way the Holy Spirit Works did you write all that down by the way now now let me reveal that while these are all Dynamic revealers and what I would say different aspects of the Holy Spirit I think an important question for us to ask is not just who who is the Holy Spirit but who is the Holy Spirit to you I'm not just talking spiritually um uh or scripturally I'm talking specifically in your day-to-day what you need to know about the Apostle Paul is he he has a genuine approach and his focus is on empowering the church through Illuminating what I would consider possibly to be the the primary function of the Holy Spirit within the Saints today and we see in his letter to the church in Rome where he reveals that the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness he he says the Holy Spirit helps us now in the context of the church in Rome they they were actually at the epicenter of culture of that day they were surrounded by the the culture changing and the culture morphing and you have the church who are not just facing external persecution they themselves are facing internal pressure so so Paul comes to them with the guide on how they're actually going to do this life in an everchanging culture within a a pagan Society how are they going to continue to be the church he says it's the holy spirit that helps you in your weakness he helps you with that internal pressure you're facing the the pressure that you and I still face today the the weight of staying pure in a pagan culture the weight of being a witness in a hostile environment and the heaviest weight of all which is not feeling worthy especially when it comes to Worship in fact what Paul does is he begins the chapter by confronting the notion that of of worth by speaking into condemnation he Paul knew all too well that weakness weakness is not merely a season weakness is a constant state sometimes we approach weakness like if I just get through this season then I'll be strong I hate to tell you but the power of sin is pretty strong the weight anybody anybody walked a few seasons with the Lord and you still feel weak this this is this is the Apostle Paul the Apostle himself said no no no no I thought weakness was just a season but after many seasons I realized that weakness is a constant state he he actually talks about it a in Corinthians after writing to the Corinthians and revealing all the things he faced he said from the dangers to the shipwrecks to the beatings to the cold and the the hunger the attempted murders he he says this in 2 Corinthians 11:28 he says besides everything else I face the daily pressure of my concern for all the churches who is weak and I do not feel weak who is led into sin and I do not inwardly burn for Paul weakness was daily like daily he questioned am I cut out for this and so to encourage the Believers in Rome he reminds them what Jesus revealed to his disciples in John 16 he says nevertheless I tell you the truth it's to your advantage this is Jesus it's your advantage that I go away for if I do not go away the helper will not come to you but if I go I will send him Jesus it was for this reason the disciples were freaking out at the fact that Jesus was going to depart from them they were like uh-uh I can't we can't do this Jesus we can't do what you do we can't be who you are we we can't when we're not strong enough but Jesus says hey hey guess what guess what it's better that I go because if I go I release the helper the NIV says The Advocate and I like that because we have an advantage with the advocate over our adversary can I did I say that teachery enough so you can write that down I'm trying to teach over this series we have an advantage because of the advocate over our adversary one of the subtle tactics of the enemy is self-help Society did you know that still looking for who I can offend it's a self-help Society I've been going in all kinds of things rest but it's a self-help society that is actually the subtle tactic of the of the enemy this self-help mentality this self-help strategies that get perpetuated in the world that we live in there is no limit to the amount of conferences that you can attend registrations you can pay for uh motivational speakers that you can sign up to not just to hear at their conference but subscribe to their newsletters to get their inspiring speeches their positive confessions and their self-help strategies I had someone tell me they went to one of these things and they walked AC cross hot coals I was like cool how did that change your life they said let me get back to you because what we're trying to do is some but but maybe maybe if I can convince you to walk across hot coals then maybe I can convince you you can overcome anything but it's not about you overcoming anything it's about what he has already overcome and because he has overcome I am already an overcomer whether I walk over hot Cals or I can admit the best self-help strategies or not I need to not lean on myself I need to lean on the holy spirit it's these conferences that will even have you convinced that the enemy is the enemy that somehow it's the enemy that that that negative voice that that internal dialogue you know what Jesus Jesus never said that you're the enemy he said the devil the enemy can I draw it really clear I know I'm really hurting some people sub subscribed to Tony Robbins and and good for him but but I'm trying to subscribe you to the Holy Spirit not some motivational speaker who's going to take your money and not give you anything in return of any substance I'm trying to give you the word of the Living God who will actually enhance your life and change your life if you would not lean on yourself but you would lean on the Holy Spirit Jesus literally said you are not the enemy The Devil is First Peter 58 be sober minded be watchful your adversary the devil prows around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour resist him stand firm in your faith knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your Brotherhood throughout the world in Revelation 12:10 the devil is called the accuser of the Brethren because he's constantly accusing you in the hope that you will shackle your sh yourself to shame that you that you remember Jesus set us free from sin and shame therefore the the chains that you were chain and imprisoned to to were broken off your life okay so therefore the devil doesn't have power to imprison you anymore but he is a master at convincing you to Shackle yourself to shame that if he can convince you that the old life and the sinful life and the mistakes that you make don't make you worthy then you end up binding yourself up however Jesus for this reason reveals we have an advocate he says to the disciples it's it's better or it's to your advantage that I go so I can send the helper and this is what Paul is wanting the Believers to understand as he as he starts the chapter can I can I read some scripture straight at you for a second I'm running out of time but I need to get this out today it's in Romans 8 let me go back to verse one he he says this and I need you to catch this in your spirit there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus for the LW of the spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death for God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin he condemns sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit can you pick up what Paul is putting down he's trying to speak to all the self-help strategies out there he's talking to all the people that perpetuate if I could just overcome me will he's saying I'm sorry your flesh is too weak I don't know we can go rounds on this we can preach this with 366 sermons for the year we could go rounds on arounds trying to convince you that you aren't strong enough or or you could sit each week in a motivational seminar with someone telling me you've got it you can do it you know just hold on keep pushing through no no it's not holding on to you it's holding on to him it's not in the flesh it's those who walk in the spirit there is a different way to work this for those verse 5 who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit for to set the mind on the flesh is death but to set the mind on the spirit is life and peace for the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God for it does not submit to God's law indeed it cannot for those who are in the flesh cannot please God verse 9 you however you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if in fact the spirit of God dwells in you anyone who does not have the spirit of Christ no not belong to him but if Christ is in you although the body is dead because of sin the spirit is life because of righteousness if the spirit verse 11 of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you it's not about you resurrecting you it's not about you overcoming you it's about Christ who is the res resurrection and the power raising your dead lifeless Body In the Flesh to New Life in him and by his power overcoming the devil you are not the enemy that's a that's a subtle tactic of the enemy to get you working against you to get you convinced that you got this you don't need nobody self-made you got you just subscribe to another seminar get a little motivational podcast this week you you got it Paul preaches something vastly different he says you're weak it's like David gogin you're weak but who's weak and I don't feel weak just in case you you thought that Paul was promoting himself above everybody else no no he said I'm with you I feel weak after everything I've done everything I've studied everything I've learned I'm weak but I'm thankful that I don't have to live in the flesh any longer I'm thankful that I get new life in the spirit I'm thankful that I don't have to operate in my sinful nature I'm not my enemy The Devil Is My Enemy I have a helper called the Holy Spirit who is an advocate that God sent to strengthen me and to help me when I don't feel worthy it's the holy spirit that reminds me of what Christ has done for me so why wouldn't I lean into the Holy Spirit you know a healthy prayer life a healthy Christian Life is one that starts each day with help me Holy Spirit just the humility not to bounce out of bed saying hey I got this I think got some good sleep my battery levels charged my Sleep Numbers good feel like I got this today no but to walk out of bed with the humility say help me Holy Spirit help me Holy Spirit help me today help me with what you've got for me help me in the assignment you put before me I want to participate in the kingdom of God but I feel weak but I'm so thankful that I've got a helper known as The Advocate the holy spirit so help me Holy Spirit every situation you go into what a healthy prayer as you walk into a board meeting as you walk into a strategy meeting as you walk into a presentation meeting help me Holy Spirit would you speak through me today give me the advantage that I have as having an advocate I know the adversary is trying to shut the power off I know the adversary is trying to work against me but I have an advantage in the holy spirit so help me Holy Spirit help me today help me in my weakness help me in my strength help me in my gifting help me in my calling that's a health y Christian

the Vive Church podcast I am so glad that you found us I trust that what God brings into your life today through this word is going to bless you expand you and grow you as a result I pray that God equips you I pray that God mobilizes you after hearing this word enjoy amen amen hey 2024 you made it this is a significant year for Kier and I this year marks uh 20 years of Ministry for us we were we were one year married when we became youth pastors at the church that we were at and uh and it was a great day actually before that our first Ministry assignment before we were ordained ministers before we were youth pastors we were group leaders believe it or not it's funny that it's group Sunday what a great assignment it is for a budding minister to lead a group and uh we had just gotten married at the time and we had a brand new house and we had decided in the process of getting the house in the prayer process of getting the house we said God if you give us a house we will make this house a second home of Jesus we will entertain people we will host people we will open our doors and sure enough we got the house so we said let's do it so we opened our house and we started a group we signed up at our church and we listed a group and um and it was interesting because I I prepared a discussion for the group Kira prepared the snacks uh but no one turned up that was awkward however we still ate the snacks and um I did discussion I said all right babe get ready week two came around I said surely you know we advertised it for two weeks in church and week two and no one came the second week we had K again prepared snacks we ate them and I did another discussion to Kira for two weeks you know what's more Awkward than no one turning up for two weeks it's on the third week when one person turns up and then you're making making like excuses for all the fake people that don't come to your group and you tell oh man everyone's busy you know that's the time of you we got so fed up with church folk we decided to invite our neighbors so I went to my neighbors we had a little duplex we're in like this little duplex Community I went down to every neighbor I invited them they started coming we had this one particular set of neighbors who came to Bible study group right they came to our group they came along and she walked in and she had a limp she had like this brace on her knee and I'm like oh man is everything okay and she's like ah it's just an athletic injury you know she kind of dismissed it and she just C came into group and I thought this is my moment you know what I'm going to stop I'm not going to do my discussion I've already done for two weeks now I'm I'm actually going to do a brand new discussion tonight I'm going to preach on the healing power of Jesus this is what I had in my mind we have got a candidate for the healing power of Jesus I'm going to preach then I'm going to pray we're going to have a miracle and we're going to have an overflowing Revival group and so I went for it I preached on the healing power of Jesus it was good too it was raw it was off the cuff but it was good and at the the end of it I I was so hyped up I said does anybody need prayer and it was crickets I'm looking around the group I'm like does anybody for anything maybe need a healing crickets everyone's looking around everyone's looking at this girl with the knee brace so I went specific and kind of made a word of knowledge I said I I feel maybe someone has a knee issue trying to make it obvious looking around like I just hey can we pray for your knee and she goes oh this I said yeah like let's I know the athletic injury let's pray for it she goes oh no it's it's okay this is my cross to bear I went excuse me she said yeah no if if Jesus wanted me healed he'd Heal Me Now obviously that sent me into a deep theological discourse with her but but but needless to say I said oh sweetheart if that was your cross to bear I hate to tell you bearing the cross of Jesus Christ is way more than that I want to make sure I tell you Vive church if you're going to Bear the cross of Jesus Christ if you're going to carry your cross it's not as convenient as an ailment cuz with an ailment I can still walk see see if you've got an ailment or an asthma or some condition I'm not going to stand stand by and let you say well this is my cross to bed that is not God's idea when he says carry your cross and before you get too excited it's way heavier it's way heavier in fact maybe we could start the year I could help you because I think it would be helpful to kick off our year with some honest assessment of what it actually takes to be a true disciple of Jesus I didn't come to play this year I came to pick a fight not with you with the Devil by the way okay you're on my side it's us together let us pick a fight but I came to pick a fight with the devil because really as a pastor of this church across the globe I want to make sure I'm developing soldiers that are committed to advancing his kingdom and there are so many goals fly around at the beginning of the new year I I would hate to give my best efforts to something this year to find out at the end of the year it fell short from anything significant truthfully above every other goal that you could possibly put on your mkin pad this year I would say the goal of being a true disciple should be right up there at the top how does this year 2024 be the year where I deepen my discipleship where I discover how to become a true disciple of Jesus and believe it or not this passage of scripture this is the context of what Jesus is talking about you see in Matthew chapter 16 we have a significant chapter of the Bible because it holds possibly one of the most pivotal moments of revealed Revelation or recorded Revelation in scripture it's in Matthew chapter 16 where we find Jesus and he's talking to the disciples and as he's talking to the disciples he asks them what seems like an outof context question he just drops it on them midc conversation and he says hey who do people say that I am just casual like and the disciples are they kind of scrambling they they kind of scramble to say what they've heard the rumors that they've witnessed going around what people have muttered in the healing moments and in the different moments where they've seen Min Jesus Minister what the gossip was and they they begin to they begin to spout what people say now you got to understand this please do not get this wrong do not Mis understand what Jesus was doing Jesus was not concerned about his public reputation what he was trying to do is he was trying to zero in on what the disciples knew what they understood because up until this point the disciples had only referred to Jesus as Rabbi teacher and and so and so what Jesus needed needed them to do was to understand exactly who he is and so what he does is he then goes from saying what do people say that I am to saying who do you say that I am and in a what we can suggest is a rare moment of Brilliance from Peter how many people feel like Peter a lot of the time like like you hardly have a moment of Brilliance but when it's good it's good well well this is Peter Peter in just this bizarre no one expected it come from Peter but in this moment Peter says you're the Messiah the Son of God and it literally stops time this moment where he revealed the first human to speak out that Jesus is the Messiah the Son of the Living God it was so Monumental it literally was and it cannot be overemphasized how pivotal this moment was in the ministry of Jesus because From This Moment forward he could begin to reveal his very mission on Earth the very reason he stepped out of heaven and stepped onto Earth could now be revealed because he was in the witness of his disciples and it goes on to say this in Matthew chapter 16: 211 from that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem he must suffer many things at the hands of the elders and the chief priests and the teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life check this out Peter took him aside remember he just had a moment of Brilliance took him aside and began to rebuke him that's what confidence will that's what overconfidence will do could you imagine just like getting a win and them being like hey Jesus he says never Lord this shall never happen to you Jesus turned and said to pet Peter get behind me Satan you are a stumbling block to me and you do not have in mind the concerns of God but merely human concerns get behind me not Peter Satan now while this could seem like a severe overreaction from Jesus what Jesus was doing was actually confronting something extremely cancerous to our Christianity which is Preservation Peter was trying to prevent Jesus from dying he I'm sure his motives were Noble no no no Lord not on my watch but he missed in that moment what the Messiah had come to do Jesus had just revealed now that you recognize me as the Messiah I must now go to die this is the cost for me to be the Messiah and Peter said says no because he was focused on preservation now if you if you happen to grow up in a church setting if you happen to kind of be around for a while especially if you in the church during the 90s there was a there was a a doctrine that was circulating around America in the 90s called a Prosperity Doctrine anybody know what I'm talking about you've been around for a minute if you're new to church good for you you don't even know about any of this but but back then there was this particular kind of doctrine that flowed around called the prosperity doctrine that that that really was focused only and solely on the blessings that come with a life with Christ it was it was focused on the benefits that come with a life with Christ Alone now while it is true that God has got a plan to prosper you we know Jeremiah 20111 we while while while God has made you an overcomer I do need to make sure you're aware that that Victory comes at a cost that there is a price to pay for following Jesus there is a cost that comes with the calling and this is what Jesus is revealing to his disciples Jesus is preparing them and he's revealing to them what the cost was not only going to be for him but for anyone who wants to be a true disciple trust me the sermon is going to get way more encouraging I I feel like I've lost you right from the first SU day of the year don't worry I I got to take you somewhere I'm more interested in who you're going to be at the end of this year than the end of today I'm going to build you over this year to to be a soldier of Jesus Christ I want to make you militant in your faith I don't want you to have a casual complacent Christianity this year I don't want you to come to Christ and add Church into your life like a convenient element to your life I want you to pursue Jesus with everything in fact let's let's just go back to our serious scripture because Jesus literally spells it out what it costs to follow to follow to be a follower of him he says then Jesus said to his disciples whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me okay so check this out Jesus starts with whoever wants to be my disciple that is so important what do you want do you want this or is or do you feel like you have to do this do you want this sometimes for those that grew up in the church and you're surrounded by Church your parents went to church and your grandparents went to church and you find yourself in church there's got to be a point where you realize I want this it can't be just a residual proximity anointing that comes with salvation no no no no I I got to want it for myself and Jesus literally offers it out there do you want this I'm talking to I'm talking to husbands that got married to wives and you didn't know Christ before you married her but now she's a part of church and you're tagging along but do you want this your wife don't get you into heaven your wife doesn't the grace that's for her is for her not for you God's got Grace for you but do you want this there's got to be a Jesus is putting it out there like I ain't going to force it on you I will compel You by Grace but but but do you want it but for anybody who wants it he says if you want this what I have to offer then you have to deny yourself now I find this an interesting phrase phase because it actually holds within this phrase deny yourself it holds the very key to understanding the cost of following Christ once you have assessed the value of something and decided that you actually want it it's a pretty good idea to consider if you're prepared to pay what it costs so Jesus says to be my disciple one must deny themselves all right let's do something this morning let's break this down I want to I want to literally unpack what it means to deny oneself because it might not be so obvious you see it would be a mistake to think that denying yourself is in the realm of self-esteem that like somehow that denying yourself is being so humble that you say oh I'm I'm literally nothing I'm nobody no that's not me I I've heard I've heard I've heard preachers do that when when some of my buddies have to encourage them I said that was a great word like oh no no it wasn't me it was all God I'm like wasn't that good okay if it was all God it would have been way better um was actually pretty average but I'm complimenting you because it was you the context of you was great the context of Jesus could have been better but but that's how we think it is to deny myself no no no not me not me no no but that's that's actually not what Jesus is called to do do you know what humility is it's a it's a true estimation of oneself and when I actually have a true estimation on myself I see that all that Christ has done in my life and I'm an overcomer that I'm more than victorious in him that I'm a conqueror in Christ Jesus and that's actually would be a true estimation myself if someone says how are you I'm Victorious because I know who I am in Christ Jesus I'm an overcomer that would be actually a true estimation of myself because throughout his word Jesus is constantly trying to build up our identity let me give you a scripture to start the year 1 Peter chap 2:9 it says but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation God's special Poss that you may declare the Praises of him who called you out of Darkness into his wonderful light once you were not a people but now you are the people of God once you had not received Mercy but now you have received Mercy what about Galatians 3:26 it says so in Christ Jesus you are all God children of God through faith for all of you who were baptized into Christ have now closed yourself with Christ this would be a good time to write down in your brand new M skin alongside your goals for the year some scriptures about your identity in Christ what about 1 Corinthians 619 that says do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have received from God you are not your own you were bought at a price therefore honor God with your bodies likewise first John chapter 3 says see what great love the father has lavished on us that we should be called children of God and what is it that and and and sorry and that is what we are the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him you see Jesus's plan is to build confidence within us as those who identify with Christ so denying yourself is not dismissing yourself that's not denying yourself so what we do need to do then is understand what does it mean to deny ourselves and to do that we need to identify what gratifies ourself in other words we need to zero in on all the things that we hold on to that I could possibly consider as qualifications for his grace now now I know you're thinking I don't do that but if you're Christianity is anything but hot if your walk with God is at some level lukewarm if there is a casual element to your Christianity I dare say you're still holding on to some qualifications by your measure that would warrant you as a recipient of God's grace let me let me show you with the Apostle Paul before you turn on me and you feel like I'm picking a fight with you I'm not picking a fight with you I'm picking a fight with the devil through you that's what I'm doing but let me go just go with me for a second and and go with me and Ln go with me with I want to show you something from the Apostle Paul in Philippians he he writes with this in mind to the Philippian church because he sees it so important for the Church of Jesus Christ the people of God to understand this he he writes this with this premise in mind addressing some of these Notions he says in Philippians 3:3 we are the circumcision who worship by the spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh though check this out I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh Also if anyone else thinks he has reasons reason for confidence in the flesh I have more check this out circumcised on the eth day of the people of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews as to the law of Pharisee as to Zeal a persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless what the Apostle does here is he presents a list of what his qualifiers are what would earn him righteousness I need some help with this sermon youth pastor Ben could you come up here come on can we welcome up youth pastor Ben I need some help with this because in the natural we see the Apostle Paul and he holds out a list elements of what he considers as qualifiers he he he he it's his achievements it's his accolades and he holds them out as his reason for self-confidence he's like if anybody had confidence in the flesh the self he says I could and he begins to list them like these little elements he says yep circumcised on the eighth day what a flex what a flex I don't even know Hebrew culture that well to know if that is a flex but on the eighth day not the ninth Rob on the eighth he adds oh he adds to it uh Hebrew of Hebrews he said let's get this one he says Tribe of Benjamin that's very fitting Ben Jamin he he says as for for passion a zealot he he says uh Pharisee of Pharisees he's just listing all these things and he's holding them out there like he's like flexing on people he he he says uh zealous I was a persecutor of the church and what we see him is he starts to just hold all these things you know he he talks about he he studied under the great gleo like that that's like the best of the best like if he he's an educated person I mean you went to school but I went to I went to Stanford that's kind of what he's saying like he's he's showing all of his all of his quals and he's holding can you do anymore like like cuz he's he's a gifted guy so he's got a lot going on the the Apostle and and I'm sure that when you start to list it out it looks pretty impressive when he's holding all these things come on we can get one more attribute in there oh no we can get more attributes no come on Ben do a better job you're the Apostle Paul come on come on Ben all right it's hard I know to juggle all these attributes stay still Ben what are you doing all right hold it no let's put this one oh right there oh no that's not going to work that's not going to work yes yes there's a finger there we go let's hold this one six days into a [Music] fast just Flex just hold this is what we look like this is what we look like this is what we look like when we're holding all our qualifications all our confidences all our reasons looks ridiculous and he lies the danger wow the danger comes when we see Jesus as another addition yeah yeah that's what we do make a little margin for Jesus like I've got all these things going on but you know I'm going to add Jesus just casually into that little pocket kind of like a little added benefit like I'm adding Jesus like an added element but you miss understand the formula for Faith the formula for faith is not addition it's [Music] subtraction go with me the formula for faith is not addition Philippians Paul goes on to say but whatever I gain I had I counted as loss for the sake of Christ indeed I counted everything as lost because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord you see you thought Jesus was another addition alongside your circumcised on the Eighth Day alongside your own accolades alongside your degrees alongside your goodness alongside your good you thought that Jesus was a little addition but I hate to tell you what Paul said he he said when I looked at everything I held out I considered it rubbish compared to the surpassing worth so I'm afraid to tell you this ball doesn't do it justice can I please get a Jes exercise ball out here bring out my cuz cuz if we're going to actually do this illustration right I need to put in comparison to all your accolades what it would be like to try and add Jesus into the mix see see this is your degree this is your status this is your confidence this is your Awards this is Jesus what Jesus has to offer is way more than what you can hold and I hate to tell that if you try and add Jesus it's not going to work Ben I want you to try and grab hold of Jesus for a moment you see to grab Jesus I have to let go of everything else and it requires me taking hold of it with both hands with both hands I can't hold everything and hold Jesus it's an either it's an either all thank you Ben thank you give it up for use Pastor Ben see Paul goes on to say as he held out all his self-security in comparison to Christ he says for his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and counted them as rubbish in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but that which comes through through faith in Christ the righteousness from God that depends on faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection you can't you can't hold your stuff and take hold of Jesus you can't hold your stuff and take hold of Jesus it requires you denying that stuff and with both hands grabbing hold of Jesus the reason Jesus says to deny yourself is because he's got way more for you what he's got is more you're just trying to add Jesus into the little crevices and Warners that you've got spare for Jesus see Jesus I got Sunday spare can you fit in there oh help me preach like this is a real Church of Jesus Christ you didn't come to a Presbyterian church today you came to a pentacostal holy spirit filled church here you are trying to just be all quiet add Jesus into the corner in the crevice of your life that's not how it works folks Jesus is an all consuming fire and he says You must deny yourself and follow me you must deny yourself and take hold with both hands with both hands whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me once you deny yourself then you can take up your cross cuz it needs both hands once you deny yourself then you can take up well what does it mean to take up your cross you see it's interesting to view this conversation between Jesus and the disciples from a from our vantage point in our modern setting as we look back over scripture and we see from the other side of the cross for us the symbol of the Cross is Victory that's why you have a cross hanging around your neck that's why you have a cross in your car wherever you have your cross because it's a position and a reminder of the victory that we have in Christ Jesus but at the moment of this discussion it wasn't a symbol of Victory it was a symbol of torture all the disciples knew about the cross was the cross that they saw criminals take the the cross on their way to their crucifixion it was a common day setting that someone by the Roman government who would be killed they would be sentenced to crucifixion they would have to carry their own cross up the streets exposing them to ridicule exposing them to shame from the people who would watch them and call them a criminal and they would cheer at them and they would cheer at them and this was the punishment that was part of the punishment and Jesus is saying to the disciples you have to carry your cross you have to carry your cross you have to carry your cross you don't just have to get crucified you have to carry your cross Jesus didn't say you want to be my follower be crucified he said carry your cross because the process of carrying your cross Is Never Done in convenience the process of carrying your cross is public it's not private you can't sneak your cross under a shirt you can't sneak your across away from the workplace you can't sneak your cross away from your family it is public to everybody when someone is a carrier of their cross it cannot be hidden it cannot be tucked away it cannot be marginalized out to a part of your life can't be private I've been doing I've been doing some some shooting lately I I got a rifle last year and I've been doing Marksmanship I'm training for something I don't know what but I'm training and I've been getting pretty good so I've been you know researching different ways to get better and and for some reason my my feed is now like my Instagram feed my social media feeds are all these advertisements on how I can get my concealed carry permit it sounds very attractive to me don't worry I'm looking into it but but but but outside of that that stuff the reality is I was realizing as I was looking at the concealed carry permit I realized that the cross you cannot conceal there's no concealed carry for the cross there's no way you can hide the cross there's no nice little shirt that you can get or a belt or whatever that you can tuck your cross away it's public to [Music] everybody it's obvious that's what Jesus was saying if you want to be my follower you can't do it in private you want to follow me you can't do it in secret you want to follow me I'm going to put a big cross on your shoulder that everyone who sees you sees there's a Christian there's a follower of Jesus he's carrying his cross it's what it takes can't do it casually can't do it quietly having died to this old life I'm sold out completely I'm sold out there's no turning back why why have to be sold out because there's a price to pay I can't preserve this thing this ain't about preserving my life I have to spend my life that's the call to follow Jesus it's a life spent in service for him it's so so oh oh oh oh Pastor it's really inconvenient when it rains to get our kids out and come to the house of God well I'm sorry to tell you but I'm spending my life it's a little bit of rain ain't going to get in my way if a little bit of rain can stop me from getting to the house of God and worshiping with the fellow Believers I better recheck my cross I better go and find where I left my cross cuz I got my raincoat on but I forgot my cross oh Pastor my my workplace they don't allow us to profess our faith well I'm sorry I'm going to have to find a new job because you cannot take your cross from me and if you want me at this workplace Christ comes with me I ain't trying to build a mega church I'm trying to build a mega army army of saints who want to move the kingdom of God forward all across the globe I've decided to follow Jesus there's no turning back there's no turning back there is no amount of life that I can preserve just in case cuz while I'm holding on to anything I haven't got a grip on Jesus while while I'm holding on to anything I can't grab a hold of all the things that God has for me and maybe the tension that you're feeling in your walk with God actually comes from the fact that you're still trying to hold on to that stuff and grab hold of Jesus when it takes a two-hand hold it takes a two-hand hold but we're trying to hold on to some of our stuff and say God I want to add you I want to add you I want to add you God says I don't want you to add me I want to be your everything I want you to abandon your security and the things that you call a qualifier and I want you to put your trust wholly and solely on [Music] me", "hey welcome to the Vive Church podcast I am so glad that you found us I trust that what God brings into your life today through this word is going to bless you expand you and grow you as a result I pray that God equips you I pray that God mobilizes you after hearing this word enjoy would you grab your bible out real quick and turn to John chapter 1 I want to set the tone for what I believe God wants to speak to us today in John chapter 1 this is a verse believe it or not this chapter I have actually this will be the fourth time I've preached from this chapter this year and extra credit if you can name all the sermons however I love it and I feel like it would be the appropriate passage to preach today let me read it to you you may not be familiar with it but John chapter 1 vers1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God he was with God in the beginning through him all things were made without him nothing was made that has been made in him was life and that life was the light of all mankind and the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness has not overcome it there was a man sent from God his name was John he came as a witness to testify concerning that light so that through him all might believe he himself was not the light he came only as a witness to the light and the True Light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world he was in the world and though the world was made through him the world did not recognized him he came to that which was his own but his own did not receive him yet to all who did receive him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of God children born not of a natural descent or a human decision or a husband's will but born of God check this out the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us we have seen his glory the glory of the one and only son who came from the father full of grace and truth today I want to come around a message I've entitled Do You Hear What I Hear You Ready for This Christmas Eve message today all right find let's say five of your

this nativity scene the other day that I I happened to bought by for uh for media in Bethlehem by the way actually from Bethlehem this where I bought this that wasn't a flex it's part of the story I uh I was I was in di menion I was in Bethlehem and uh you know I I had going into my trip to Bethlehem I had an expectation not that Bethlehem would look like this but I was speaking about the experience I was expecting you see a couple of us had had a trip to to Israel and we were in Bethlehem and and and it wasn't what I expected you see as we went into this this particular day we went in with a guide we went in on a little mini bus and we were so excited about the things we were going to experience had no no context to what to expect except this nativity scene this is all I'd ever seen or understood or expected that we would find in Bethlehem and when we got there we I was so excited we pull up to this side street and and as we pull up I go to open the door and that driver says hey let's just wait a minute I said okay we're going to pray uh what are we going to do and so we just said okay we'll stop and he's like we just you know what we're going to do we're just going to sit here for a minute and I said okay that's cool great idea you know we just had breakfast you don't want to kind of get too excited to rush ahead we might as well just Ponder and and appreciate the moment we're in Bethlehem the the birthplace of Jesus what a great pause a moment just to pause a moment just to reflect a moment to compose yourself not just get out your camera and be in the phone but be in the moment I get it driver great uh pause but we sat there not for a minute we sat there for about 5 minutes and then 10 minutes and we're looking around at each other uh Andrew was there Vance was there Vlad was there we we we started to look at each other and we said hey um uh is it is everything okay he's like oh everything's fine now when someone drags out fine you know it's not fine he's said we're just going to wait for a contact now now I'm I'm good waiting for a friend but a contact that's different when you're waiting for a contact that means there is something going on so I'm on high alert at this point and finally after about 20 minutes of waiting in this van this contact comes they they they speak in Arabic something in the window uh to each other and then he turns to us and puts a smile on he forgot to smile first he turned smiled and said we ready to go I said okay let's go and we went into a particular church and it was all good we we went down into a a really cool basement that only Russian people could go to and and and so they looked at Vance they looked at Andrew and said you can't go they looked at me and Vlad and they pointed to me and said you look Russian I pointed to Vlad I said he is Russian and and they said okay you can go too then I guess uh and we it was just amazing fun experience I got lost in the moment and as we were heading back towards the van we went through like a gift shop it's like this store and in the store they had all these nativity scenes different size ones different different priced ones different types of wood some you know kind of date wood and different things and I'm looking through the gift shop I'm like this wasn't on the itinerary but this is cool just perusing and no intention to buy just looking and at the end of our time in there we're we're done I mean men don't shop for long all right so we had a quick walk through and went cool let's go and he's like oh our gu said um you know what uh this is where you buy things I said no I'm I'm good I got luggage I don't really you know I pack light you know that kind of stuff he's like no I'd really urge you to buy something after a little pause for my brain to catch up remembering that he had a contact I thought you know what my daughter could do with a nativity see I found the cheapest one I could sorry honey but I found the cheapest one I could and we've had it since I never expected to get hustled in Bethlehem now now hold that hold that thought of expectation just for a moment because I want to do something today at this Christmas Eve service I want to use the the framework of the Christmas carol that we just sung a a a and this chapter in John the framework of the Christmas carol three particular stanzas Do You Hear What I Hear do you know what I know and listen to what I say in combination with John chapter 1 to really allow God to speak to us at the end of this year and to start us off I do have a question to ask you what's your expectation around hearing God better still what do you expect God to sound like that's a good question what does God sound like I know my it may seem like a bit of a heavy question to to to kind of ask on the last inperson Gathering of the year but but how does God speak if we're hoping to hear God this Christmas I'm wondering if we know how God speaks I mean is it an internal voice is it an external or or or or better still an audible voice does God speak more through signs and circumstances like a series of O of open doors patterns or green lights unfortunately what you're going to find is the Bible doesn't really give us the clearest expectation because throughout the Bible you will find that God actually spoke in a myriad of ways from conveying messages through angels and Prophets and judges es and wise men to speaking audibly through a through a donkey and through a burning bush to to speaking silently through a a hand a magical hand riding on a wall to to to all kinds of different ways in fact God even spoke directly through dreams and visions and he spoke generally through signs and wonders which maybe reveals that that God speaks often in most unexpected ways actually that's the best thing I can give you if you're going to expect God to speak expect the unexpected is it good that that's what you can expect that if you're trying to box God in or frame God out or find a formula to if you could do something for God to speak guess what he may just break that picture that you have he may just speak through your marriage he may just speak through your children he may just speak through a circumstance God loves to kind of take what we least expect to use it to reveal something that he wants to do in our life for instance in the Old Testament you have a particular and prominent Prophet called Elijah who who famously you might know the story took on 450 false prophets of ba and he killed them all this is what a prophet it was a a prophet's job was was busy in those days you didn't just speak on behalf of God you had to kill people as well bring it back and um for the for the kingdom for the kingdom it was and these false prophets they were opposing God's plan and so he little Showdown and then he he literally took him out to 450 false prophets killed with his bare hands and then there's this moment in First Kings chapter 19 where Elijah really needs to hear from God he he he faced off with 450 prophets and now he's on the run from one single woman and while he's on the Run he's desperate to hear from God and it says this in First Kings chap 19:1 it says the Lord said go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord for the Lord is about to pass by it says then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind there was an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake came a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire came a gentle whisper and when Elijah heard it he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood the mountain of the cave and the voice said to him what are you doing here elah a whisper A A Small Voice which begs the question when it comes to God's speaking is it about if God speaks or how God speaks or better still could it be a matter of whether we're listening we know God speaks the Bible makes that so clear many different ways God is not limited to one way of speaking God has got unlimited when ways that's what you can deduct from the word of God and the stories and the series of ways that God speaks is your conclusion couldn't be can can emphatically be that God speaks the mystery isn't if God speaks the mystery is are we are we listening are we listening believe it or not this is the very tension that John is presenting in the opening chapter of the Gospel that we read after revealing that the word God himself stepped into the world that he created we see that the world did not receive him let me read it again just for your context it says in verse 9 the True Light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world he was in the world and though the world was made through him the world did not recognize him he came to that which was his own but his own did not receive him okay so John John is revealing something incredibly significant here that we need to grab a hold of because as you study John's gospel you will find Jesus teaching people that he is the Fulfillment of everything that that was typified in the law in other words it was not enough to be born a Jew they had to be born again this was what was if we boil everything down to Jesus message as he was walking out one of the things that he wanted to translate the most to the Israelite Nation those that were that were born God's people those that were born into the traditional family of God as we see laid out through Abraham in the old Covenant everyone that was born into the Israelite Nation Jewish born Jewish descent who were traditionally God's people Jesus came with a message to say it is now not good enough just to be born Jewish you actually have to be born again this is very very clear throughout scripture you have to do a lot of spiritual gymnastics to hurdle over this statement within scripture that Jesus says it is essential for everybody born to be then born spiritually to be reborn again and what you'll find is that Jesus's Miracles weren't just random acts or displays of power they were revealers of this message from multiplying the Loaves and the fish to calming the wind and the waves Jesus Jesus was actually revealing himself as the Creator but the people were so Shackled by religious Traditions that they could not see and they could not hear what Jesus was saying and as John reveals Jesus came to his own world I want you to get the gravity of this Jesus came to his own world that he had created but his own People Israel could not hear him and they would not receive him could you imagine just on some scale what that that that that feels like for your very own maybe you started a company you founded a company and then somehow your board AED you as the founder hey I built this thing well multiply that by a million Jesus created the world his very own nation that God said I will carve out of all the nations of the world my very own people through whom I can show my love my devotion my protection and my power it's upon those people that every Other Nation will look and say how great is that God but when he came to the world those very people were rejected him this is what John's trying to reveal the the drama in the moment he saw his Works they they they they heard his words they observed his perfect life and he gave them every opportunity to grasp the truth believe and be saved but they rejected him you see Jesus is the way but they went their own way Jesus is the truth but they preferred what was false and Jesus was the the life he is the life and they wanted to take his life now we can see that Jesus wasn't the military leader that they were expecting that they were hoping for a messiah that would come in with a new Empire that would overthrow Roman rule they were they were UND dimensional in their expectation but maybe Jesus also wasn't what they were wanting well we know he wasn't what they were expecting but as I read through the stories and I see the pattern and I see the interactions the more and more I'm convinced he actually wasn't what they were wanting you see it's one thing to have an unmet expectation it's a whole other thing to have an unmet desire Do You Hear What I Hear or we're not hearing what we want to hear as Christmas Carol got me thinking I'm telling you because we have we have actually something today that the Israelites didn't have we have to our advantage the written word of God and I dare say that God speaks most prominently today through his word God is not limited to speaking through his word but I would dare say he most Pro prominantly speaks through his written word so little shortcut if you actually want to hear from God this Christmas read God that's like just best pastoring I can give you and so he's most prominantly I mean it's funny to me how so many people want to hear from God but not willing to read God but if you just pick up the word of God you'll find that God will speak to you so loud and so clear it'll be like something speaking right to your soul I want to I want to just encourage you I want to provoke you I want to entice you somehow to get into your word over this Christmas break if you got time off work don't take time off God get deeper into God get deeper into the word because I know that it will set you up for what God wants to do in and through your life in the year to come it's this Christmas Carol that's got me thinking are we hearing what the word says or are we not hearing because it doesn't say what we want it to say because what it doesn't say is it doesn't give us permission to live the way we want instead it CS us to live holy and to turn from sin in fact I actually wonder if hearing is a result of knowing Do You Hear What I Hear do you know what I know for instance do you know that Jesus didn't come into the world to bring peace to it at least not the way we think now that that's the silence I expected you're like hang on I was with Pastor up until that moment where he literally just said it's on YouTube it's going to be recorded looped and played back that Jesus didn't come to bring peace to the world let me double down and make sure you get it clearly open your phone and press voice record Jesus did not come into the world to bring peace to it I know what you thinking I thought I was sitting in a church I thought it was Christmas Eve I remember the story of the star and the announcement and the angels who said peace on Earth hello what about Isaiah for he he famously prophesied about the birth of Jesus saying in Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born to us a son is given and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father Prince of Peace it's there however can I help us get a clear picture on something today because while Jesus is certainly the Prince of Peace don't get that wrong Jesus himself reveals I think something more shocking in Matthew 10 where he reveals in verse 32 whoever acknowledge me acknowledges me before others I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven but whoever disowns me before others I will disown before my Father in Heaven do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to Earth I did not come to bring peace but a sword likewise in Luke 12:51 do not think I came to bring peace on Earth no I tell you but division sometimes our understanding of peace is peaceful situations like no Wars like no conflict like everyone in Blissful Harmony have you ever had that expectation like like we're pray like every every Miss Universe World Peace like like like we want we there like there's this place we're getting to in life where everything's in harmony like like like righteousness is everything in harmony like Blissful Harmony like Blissful ignorance more like we we we dared to go um to the Mall a couple weeks ago and and we thought it was safe because it was actually a couple weeks before Christmas and we when we don't go to the mall that much but we went to the mall and and we were we had two vehicles that were both in we're in our car and Dia had her car and we were trying to navigate the parking lot and it was insane anybody know what I'm talking about some of you got hot flushes right now just hearing this and as we're navigating like we were stuck for so long just sitting still because there were these two people trying to fight of a one parking space and they neither were moving they're like they're just going to outlast each other you know what I mean and one finally outlasted the other one gave up and pulled in and we finally got the traffic flowing and it was the funniest thing to me because as we drove past the person who won the park they had a sticker on the back of their car I don't know if you've seen it says coexist and it's got like all the different religions on it like like Harmony is what we need except when it comes to parking spaces then everything's off I don't care who you are I don't care what you believe I don't care what religional background you're from that's my world peace is not the goal Harmony is not the goal I I I don't mean to offend your sensibility or your ideas of what the world will look like when the Christians actually rise up and the church is advaned but Jesus makes it very clear that when I come into your life expect persecu ution when the Prince of Peace comes into your world it provokes hate when the Prince of Peace comes into your world it creates a divide when the Prince of Peace comes into your life it creates a difference between who you are and how you live and what it looks like to be holy what it looks like to be righteous Romans 5 reveals it I think really well because of sin we were enemies of God in fact I want I want you to know this Jesus came to bring peace on Earth not peace to Earth there's [Music] difference he came to bring peace while we walk through this wretched World while we work Walk Through This World that's divided and separated from God that's consumed by their sin but yet somehow that's why we have the peace that surpasses all understanding because why is it that the Believers have peace when the world has chaos and so God didn't bring peace to the world he brought peace on Earth that's in us and through us and Romans 5 reveals it it says this you see in verse six at just the right time when we were still powerless Christ died for the ungodly very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die but God demonstrates his own love for us in this that while we were still sinners Christ died for us since we now have been justified by his blood how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him verse 10 for if while we were God's enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his son how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life verse 11 not only is this so but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received reconciliation this is the peace that surpasses all understanding when you don't know what I know it's difficult To Hear What I Hear actually let me reverse it the way the the Carol presents it to Hear What I Hear You have to know what I know that comes as a result of listening to what I say now the active imperative of that word listen is actually do that's what listen the active imperative is do it's not just a passive lesson like someone's telling you something it's a lean and listen you ever listened for something there's a difference from just hearing to listening hearing is passive listening is intent listening requires a leaning listening requires a pressing in in other words our belief in God is evident through our obedience to God see see the strength of our faith is shown through the doing of what's laid out in his word this is how Jesus says at Luke Luke 6:46 it says why do you call me Lord Lord and not do what I say as for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice I will show you what they are like they're like a man building a house who dug down deep and laid a foundation on Rock when a flood came the torrent struck the house but could not shake it because it was wellb built but the one verse 4 who hears my words and doesn't put them into practice the passive hearing the the one who can sit in Sunday after Sunday and just hear but not do the the one that's not listening but they're just hearing the one that's hearing and saying god what have you got for me today as opposed to the one who's seeking and listening for what God wants to do it sounds the same but it's very different in the posture of your heart the one that can say all right God what do you got for me or the one that's saying God here I am what you got for me this is the difference that person does not put them into practice is like a man who built his house on the ground without a foundation and the moment the torrent struck that house it collapsed exactly his destruction was complete okay so Jesus puts a major emphasis and a connection on hearing and actually doing I mean that's that's that's that's Romans 10:17 right faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God see every time Jesus spoke about the kingdom it was the most difficult reality for the Pharisees to to get and grasp it was difficult for them because they were locked in on a ritual completely missing the relationship Jesus was offering as we read in John it says yet to all who did receive him yes sir see the world that he came to the world that he created his very own people they did not receive him they rejected him and if you stop the story there it'd be very sad of a rejected savior but because of the grace of God it says to those who did receive him talking about his grace saying I'm opening up those who are now God's people those who did receive him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of God children born not of a natural descent or human decision or husband's will but born of God I heard this quote this week stuck with me all week there are none so blind as those who refuse to see reminded me of Matthew 13:13 where Jesus said this is why I speak to them in Parables though seeing they do not see and though hearing they do not understand [Music] you want God to speak to this season are you listening are you actively listening are you leaning in are you just taking the posture of if God wants to speak he knows where I am had an uncle like that was on Mom's side of the family why is it always mom's side of the family I don't know but Mom side of the family they were our unchurched side of the family I always found a little mission to kind of bring up God in some setting and he would always take this posture if God wants to speak to me he knows where I am there's always confusing me because I'm like well that's kind of true he God sees everything God sees everyone God knows exactly where he is God why would't you just speak to him and show him like you all the way you speak through the word through donkeys through burning bushes through crazy means all these kinds of fascinating ways like here is someone who's literally saying if God speaks to me I'll believe and it wasn't until I read through John where I realized that hearing and listening are different that you can approach God from this posture of saying well if I hear I hear but are you pressing in to listen to what he actually wants to say to you what he has for your life what he wants to do in your life what he has the the gifts that he has for you the Salvation he has for you the Redemption that he has to you are you are you listening this is why the Bible says to him who has ears let him [Music] hear", "hey welcome to the Vive Church podcast I am so glad that you found us I trust that what God brings into your life today through this word is going to bless you expand you and grow you as a result I pray that God equips you I pray that God mobilizes you after hearing this word enjoy in fact I wanted to do something I wanted to read a passage of scripture to you yeah why don't you go ahead and take a seat real quick and maybe I could read to you the scripture of the story we just had presented to us it's in Mark 4:35 it says that that day when evening came he said to his disciples let us go over to the other side and leaving the crowd behind they took him along just as he was in the boat there were also other boats with him and a furious Squall came up and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped and Jesus was in the stern sleeping on a cushion the disciples were woke him and said teacher don't you care if we drown he got up rebuked the wind in the waves said to the waves quiet be still then the wind died down and it was completely calm he said to his disciples why are you so afraid do you still have no faith verse 41 they were terrified and asked each other who is this even the wind and the waves obey him now I got to say that I I love that we presented this from Peter's perspective because what we get with Peter is maybe a deeper Revelation on the intensity that came with the storm sometimes you can read through scripture and miss the emphasis until we put ourselves in the place and what we have is Peter one of the disciples revealing that it was intense however I have to admit there's something confusing to to me about this particular situation because when I think about it most of the men that were in this boat I'm talking about Jesus's disciples more than half of them were fishermen career fishermen meaning that as fishermen I would have to think that at some point in their life they've experienced a storm or two in fact being out there day in day out night in Night Out in especially in the unpredictable region of the Sea of Galilee where winds can come in from all directions that any given notice is kind of have to be common practice for a fisherman to be experienced with a storm to have some level of experience within that situation but it's confusing to me being career fisherman maybe spending all that time out there but now the Bible says they were completely terrified afraid that they were going to drown wondering if Jesus cares because he's asleep I wonder if you've been in that situation maybe you haven't wondered if Jesus is sleeping in your stormy situation but but maybe you've wondered if he's even aware because he seems so silent and the silence make him seem distant like are you even aware Jesus of what I've got going on like like Jesus was at least in their boat I can't even find Jesus in my proximity I feel like the silence I know Jesus doesn't got to sleep but maybe he doesn't even know what's going on do I do I seem insignificant to God Almighty in fact I wonder if Peter and the disciples were terrified not because they hadn't experienced storms but maybe because they weren't expecting a storm I say that because they had previously left their Nets to follow Jesus what that means is they left that life to follow Jesus they they had this idea that Jesus came to them and said hey follow me and I'll make you fishes of men and I'm sure that in that moment they thought wow what an upgrade we're going to go from fishing and storms and unpredictability to now following Jesus life's going to be great no more storms for us w're expecting that with Jesus you still get storms I I know it seems silly but I wonder if we expect the same thing that by following Jesus now there's no more storms in my life life's going to go well everything's going to be great everybody's going to love me things are going to be swell and then we get surprised by the storm we get surprised by the things that were with me before I met Christ are still circulating and percolating in my life in such a way that I'm confused they're still there what's the benefit of following Jesus see this is often what I find confusing in the life of the Christian is the expectation that since Jesus the prince of peace is in my life won't I now have peace from any storm I got to admit something I I'm not usually the kind of guy that gets tricked on a Black Friday sale but this year I did don't get me wrong I'm I'm a culprit for you know responding to a well positioned advertisement I bought all kinds of things all kinds of tools in the hope of being a handyman but with no plans for re Renovations and I've bought tile cutters that I've never used I've bought things before because it seemed good at the time and and this Black Friday it got me I saw an ad for sailing and I thought that life looked good and the ad came with a a sailing jacket I bought it in fact can you bring out my sailing jacket just to prove it this is let me swap jacket let me take my preaching jacket and Tra trade it for this sailing jacket where is that there you go this is pretty much what it looked like when Kira got home I'm walking around our house with a stormy sailing jacket on and she's like what are you doing I said I just bought it but we're in like we're in like a California winter so it's still like 70\u00b0 outside and I'm walking around inside and just hoping it's going to rain or something and she said it looks ridiculous I'm like no but but I'm but but but it got me and as she said look I I started to clamber for this this tag because this tag actually had the advertisement that got me it says this it says designed and developed in Norway since 1877 that's some experience y'all hel Hansen continues to create professional grade apparel that helps people stay and feel alive through insights drawn from living and working in the world's harshest environments we have delivered a long list of first to Market Innovations and award-winning products that give you the confidence to pursue your passions wherever they take it was the it was the conf confidence line that got me and as I read the confidence line I started preaching at my baby I said honey I got confidence to pursue my passions I got I got the this jacket gives me the the comp you see what would be crazy if anybody bought this jacket thinking that this jacket propelled storms that somehow the storms don't want to come near this jacket but when you're wearing this jacket and you invest in this jacket that this jacket positions you to repel storms that would be be crazy what an obnoxious idea that somehow a jacket repel storms but it doesn't repel storms if anything It prepares you for the storms if anything it gives you the confidence to go into the storms that's what I you know what's really crazy I'm just waiting for a storm cuz I really want to use my jacket I don't even know what this clear part's for but it's I'll find out in the storm see this is often how we treat our faith wow like our faith means will never go through anything what if your faith was to equip you to go through everything what if what if there's things about your faith that you only find in the storm I didn't even know what that was for but I was in the storm and I realized that's what that Faith was for you know what's crazy I feel feel like Peter was confused like we often are that somehow peace is found from the storm when Jesus was trying to reveal that peace is for the storm what what's the use of having peace when the waters are calm no one's clambering for peace in peaceful times it was in the midst of the chaos where you need to find peace that's what Jesus is equipping us with in fact if you unpack the story correctly you will see that Jesus was the one that actually guided them into the storm ultimately with the aim of revealing that he has control over it we got this gigantic mural that I put up in the volunteer team HQ which reads a good sailor never learned from calm seas and I love it I love it because it reminds me that we can so often get busy trying to avoid the storms of life rather than using them to our advantage using them to reveal what we didn't know we had all this time and what we've learned and how to navigate things because maybe God's going to equip us with things so that we can be peace in the storm so that in the storms of life that others are facing that maybe God can fill us with peace so then fill them with peace cuz we've learned some things processed some things what if what if God allows storms what if God allowed storms so that we can learn learn to navigate a new way develop the kind of confidence that comes from having Jesus at the helm in other words having Jesus with you in the storm in fact if you go ahead and read the Bible correctly peace is never painted as a place peace is always presented as a person and his name is Jesus peace is not the place you get to when life is over and you finally find peace peace is the realization that in every season I've walked through in life he's been with me all along he's been in my boat Jesus says it this way in John 14:27 he says peace I leave with you my peace I give to you not as the world gives do I give to you let not your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid Jesus prepares us with peace now I got to be honest with you I have been Saed in before a couple years ago some friends took us out on the San Francisco Bay and the the day that they decided to take us out it was a windy day it was crazy it was so windy that the Sailing Boat was sideways they had this guard rail on the side of the boat and it was actually underwater now everyone on the boat would have been nervous if the captain wasn't smiling so much everyone's freaking out but the captain he's grinning ear to ear he cannot wipe the smile off his face because for the captain you need wind to sail many times he told us that he'd been out and there's no wind you're not sailing you're sitting but it's when you have the presence of wind that you actually begin to sail what's the use of a Sailing Boat if you don't have any wind I thought I thought Captain's going to preach right now cuz so many people go out on a little Charter hoping that they have calm Waters but what are you going to do just motorboat around or maybe you could get some behind yourselves maybe you could learn to navigate what the thrill of life is when you go with Jesus and the storms of life don't swamp you you begin to sail you don't begin to sink like you used to before Christ but now with Christ in the boat we begin to rise above we begin to sail on the waters we use the propulsion of the wind to move God's kingdom forward why was he smiling cuz the captain's in control control we were hanging on for dear life but the captain he was in control it reminds me of Hebrews 12:2 talking about the captain of our faith Jesus saying looking to Jesus the founder and the perfector of our faith who for the joy was set before him endured the cross for the joy that was set before him I feel like the cap of our boat was smiling this depicts Jesus our captain of our faith smiling through it all smiling through the persecution smiling through the pain smiling through it not because he enjoyed it but for the joy that was set before him which was us that on the other side of his crucifixion was us and our freedom on the other side of his pain and his whipping and his beating was our freedom on the other side of all those things the storm was swelling around Jesus but he could smile through it because he was in control he said nobody take takes my life I lay it down he was in control Jesus mastered the waves and the storm he had peace through it all because he had peace through it all he gives us his peace today I want to pray for some people would you stand to your feet cuz the truth of the matter is we well not find anywhere in the Bible where there will be a promise trust me I've I've read it through I've looked for it so let me save you the trouble you will not find anywhere in the Bible that promises a life of following Jesus where you won't have struggle and you won't have storms in life Jesus does not promise that not even once however what he does promise time and time again is his presence what he does promise time and time again is that you will not be alone and what he does promises that he himself will be with you through every season that's the promise that he has for [Music] us", "hey welcome to the Vive Church podcast I am so glad that you found us I trust that what God brings into your life today through this word is going to bless you expand you and grow you as a result I pray that God equips you I pray that God mobilizes you after hearing this word enjoy I wanted to uh maybe just share something with you because it's a a new way to look at a classic story to see it from a different perspective and I don't know I don't know if watching that maybe there was something that you knew about the Christmas story but you didn't notice before like mung beans I don't know if there is something that you may have missed in fact this week in preparation for the production and uh and all the things that have been going on and getting ready for Christmas we had a bit of a busy week we had some of our new pastor friends come into town and we got an opportunity to connect with some new pastors some new friends and I don't know what it's like when you meet new friends the get to know you stage is always fun I don't know where you start but inevitably when you're getting to know somebody if you've been with them for a couple of moments we were in the car for about two hours together and as we're talking the question came up how did you meet it's a great get to know your question and generally in our relationship between kir and I I'm the one to give the story but this time because I was doing something she wasn't doing anything I was driving she decided to tell the story and as she told the story of how we met I realized there's some things from her perspective that I don't share when I tell the story like when I tell the story of how we met it always goes like this for three years it took me three years to convince her to like me and as I'm listening to the story I heard it from her perspective where in her perspective she said it took three years for him to notice me that is not the truth she gave a false Narrative of a true story in fact it was crazy to me it was crazy to me how I didn't consider things from her point of view which makes me wonder how often do we miss things in areas of our life that maybe God's wanting to reveal do we possibly do this even with the Christmas story could we maybe be missing something in an age-old story that maybe we've heard a thousand times but maybe we're missing it because we're seeing it from a limited point of view well believe it or not the Apostle Paul talks about this very idea in scripture when he's writing to the church in Corinth the Apostle Paul brings up this idea of point of view that maybe you've approached things from a human point of view in fact let me read it to you he's writing to the church hoping to reorient their perspective it says this in 2 Corinthians chapter 5:16 it says so we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view at one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view but how differently we know him now this means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person the old life is gone and a new life has begun what an interesting thing this is that Paul reveals how differently he knows and how he sees Jesus now you see for Paul to say that reveals that there was once a time where Paul missed it where Paul didn't see it the way that he was meant to see it he saw it from a different perspective and to understand this you actually need to know another story which is the story of Paul Paul as a young fervent Pharisee a young man who was passionate and zealous for God back when he was actually called Saul who when in that time he actually opposed the church and went about killing Christians in fact he was authorized by the authorities to execute anyone that was found to be claiming to be followers of Jesus and he actually saw it as his duty he saw it as his zealous Duty because he was zealous for God that he had to eradicate the Earth of any followers of the way now what we see in Acts chapter nine is we find that there while he's on the road to Damascus on his way to eradicate the Christians to hunt them out and to kill any followers of the way that he found there was suddenly a bright light that Shone on the road a blinding light that knock saw off his donkey blinding him literally blinding him he could not see but it was an amazing indication of of why in that moment as the voice from Heaven Jesus says Saul Saul why are you persecuting me this was a reality moment for Paul because he had thought this whole time that he was working for God he was convinced in his zealous actions in his religious Duty that he was actually working for God but in one moment of Revelation he realized that he was not working for God he'd been working against God and in that moment he was blinded physically which was an indication that he may have been seeing in the natural but he'd been blind spiritually up until this point this is why he says this to the Corinthians he says at one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view how differently we know him now you see previously Paul's perspective was all about him that was the Viewpoint of Paul the way that he approached God the way that he approached Faith was all about himself what is it that I can do for God how zealous can I be how religious can I be how meticulous as a Pharisee could he be to make sure he he upheld every element of the law it was all about how good he could be for God and in a moment the perspective it shifted he realized in all his passion in his strict obedience and in his own efforts he still could not be holy however in one moment when Jesus arrested his perspective he revealed something significant not just for Paul Paul but I also believe for us and I want you to stay with me just for a moment I want I want you to lean in because this is what the whole Christmas season is about and I do have to say that we often view the Christmas story from as just as a story maybe of a savior being born in an unexpected way a savior being born a baby in a manager I mean a Manger but I but I'm wondering if maybe there's something different this year maybe it's not something different about the story Maybe there's something different about you maybe there's something different that's happened in your life that gives you a different Vantage Point see no matter how you tell it it's the same old story no matter how we present it it's still the same story but I'm wondering if just maybe what's happened in your life this year has shifted your perspective to see it differently than before now believe it or not it's going to be hard hard to believe but before I was a pastor I was an electrician and in my early years of being an electrician studying how to be an electrician I had to learn all the tools of the electrical trade and there's this one tool that we had to learn it was called The Analog multimeter and this multimeter had a little gauge on it that when you put two prongs on an electrical circuit it would read the voltage of the electrical circuit it had a little needle that would move up depending on how much voltage was in that circuit it would give you a reading and an indication of the the the how much electricity how much current how much voltage was going through that particular circuit now now what was interesting it wasn't just a needle but behind the needle was a mirror and what they taught us in electrical school is that the mirror was essential to make sure you didn't read the meter wrong because if you were looking at the meter from the side you would get what's called paralex error I know it sounds interesting it's all I learned in all of my electrical training but parallx error struck me because it made me think how often do we read situations wrong looking at situations from our Vantage Point our perspective that may not be aligned with and that's what the mirror did the mirror made sure that when you line the reflection of the needle with the needle you got the accurate reading sometimes God wants to use our situations in life and our circumstances with a story and when we align those two we actually get a correct reading we get a correct reading see what we see with the Apostle Paul as he was approaching ho from what he could do rather than what Jesus had done for him something shifted in Paul we see he was blinded physically which meant he could no longer see things the way he did before let me ask I wonder if something has happened to you unexpected this year I wonder maybe there's a circumstance that took you by surprise or a disappointment that left you confused or a diagnosis that left you shell shocked and maybe the way you see things has changed you see sometimes in these moments it's the ability to see things differently that's the key what I mean is sometimes the pain that you experience can serve you with a different perspective sometimes loss will even illuminate what we take for granted and before that situation and maybe before that disappointment or even before that diagnosis you couldn't see what you were looking for however I wonder if now is the right time to see what you previously missed you see later in Corinthians Paul's letter to the church he talks about his this particular timing saying in 2 Corinthians chapter 6 ver1 he says as God's Partners we beg you not to accept this marvelous gift of God's kindness and then ignore it for God says at just the right time I heard you on the day of salvation I helped you indeed the right time is now today is the day of salvation much like the multimedia needs both the needle and the mirror to line up to get a correct reading what if the revelation of Jesus that he's trying to reveal to you is seen against the backdrop of your situation you see Paul reveals this to the church he reveals that it requires a New Perspective he reveals in verse 18 that Christianity isn't about a religious requirement or what we could possibly do for God he reveals that it is indeed a gift that comes from revelation of who Jesus is and what Jesus has done what Jesus has done not what you could do he goes on to write this to the church in verse 18 and all of this is a gift from God who brought us back to himself through Christ and God has given us this task of reconciling people to him for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself no longer counting people's sins against them and he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation this is why Paul was so passionate in sharing the good news of Jesus he goes on to say so we are Christ's ambassadors and God is making his appeal through us we speak for Christ see Paul had previously spoken for himself everywhere he went he gave his resume how good he'd been for God how well he'd kept the law how meticulous he was how passionate was how zealous he was who he studied under he constantly gave his resume and his repertoire of why he deserved to be counted amongst the religion but now on the other side of that blinding moment in the Revelation where he lost his physical sight it opened up his spiritual eyes to see that it wasn't what he did for Christ but what Christ had done for him that's why he says when we speak we speak about Christ for God made Christ who never sinned to be the offering for our sins so that we could be made right with God through Christ because of Paul's situ situation he can now write and see things differently let me ask again I wonder what's happened in 2023 in your life I wonder what it is this year maybe the circumstances that you faced maybe the situations that you didn't expect maybe job loss family loss there's all kinds of things that will take place within a calendar year that maybe could cause you to question things or even cause you to see things from a different perspective maybe be the filter through which God wants to reveal a story that you thought you knew so well but didn't see it the way he's calling you to see it maybe you see it from a human point of view because of what you've experienced may maybe there's an opportunity to see it for what it actually is the story of God loving us so much much that he sent his son to take from us our sin and make us holy a story of our savior who was born so that he could die for us in our place so that we may have eternal life I like the way he being Paul presents it in verse 14 he says this in 2 Corinthians 5:14 I want you to catch this in your spirit he says either way Christ's love controls us come on another way to put it was Christ's love compels us he's like I used to do this in my own effort trying to measure how good I could be how holy I could be but Paul realized he fell so far short when all his work and Good Deeds got him nowhere in all this time thought he was working for God he had the Revelation he's working against God he says I've shifted my perspective he's like now Christ love compels us since we believe that Christ died for all we also believe that we have all died to our old life verse 15 he died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves instead they will live for Christ who died and was raised for them this was Paul's Revelation through encountering Jesus that this ain't about living for me this ain't about just trying to preserve my life and behave my life and obey my life in such a way that I earn righteousness it's about living for Christ who died for me who opened up a way for me that I could not open myself this is what the story of Christmas is about it's about a baby born in a manger but it's about a gift from God to save your soul to do what you could not do for yourself the weight of the world will be upon his shoulders that God made a way for you to receive righteousness where where you could not earn righteousness Paul was one who tried every measure that he could from his human perspective from his limited perspective from his point of view he tried everything he could to earn it but fell short even at the height of his obedience but upon receiving and hearing from Jesus he got the Revelation it's not what I can do it's what he's done it's what he's done and it's who he is see that's the story of Christmas the story of Jesus Jesus loved us so much that he came he took our sins so that we can receive new [Music] life", "hey welcome to the vibe Church podcast I am so glad that you found us I trust that what God brings into your life today through this word is going to bless you expand you and grow you as a result I pray that God equips you I pray that God mobilizes you after hearing this word enjoy this is our final week in our vision series and instead of preaching another sermon at you I thought I would I would have a vision discussion today let's talk Vision let's have let's bring you into a discussion I would love so much of said this before to to be able to have a vision discussion with each and every person cuz I know that you may be new to the church you haven't been around long enough to see us go through vision season and there may be a question like why do we center around Vision here at Vibe Church why is that so important for us and as much as I would love to have a one-on-one discussion with each of you I can't it's not possible so I thought I would host a discussion you could watch and you can participate and so we're going to do that today but I do want to frame it with some scripture let me read a passage of scripture to you would you open your Bible to the Book of Daniel we've spent a whole series anyway in the Book of Daniel uh in many ways just looking at the different elements of Daniel Daniel's life and how he modeled in any way faith I want to go to Daniel chapter 3 and I want to talk to you about one of the most well-known stories that I would say are in the Bible the fiery furnace you don't even have to be a believer to know this story I've heard this story about three young men who did not bow to the golden idol made in the image of King Nebuchadnezzar instead they chose to stand even though the penalty was to be thrown in the fiery furnace so let's pick it up in Daniel chapter 3 I want to read from verse 13 it says then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach meach and abedo be brought so they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them it is it true oh Shadrach mhach and Abednego that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn the pipe the tigon the Trion sorry har bagpipe and every kind of music to fall down and worship the image that I have made well and good but if you do not worship you shall immediately be cast into the burning fiery furnace and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands Shadrach meach Abednego answered and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we have no need to answer you in this matter if this be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of your hand O King but if not be it known to you oh King that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up I want to kind of leave it there I want to talk from this idea and this topic today as we come around a vision discussion and I still want you to take notes I still feel like there's some things you could learn today and to frame your note Tak I want to give you the title stand anyway stand anyway you ready for the word of God all right time to get happy find three your neighbors smile at them and then take your seat would you do that real quick find three people to smile at don't scare them just smile just smile just smile thank you worship team well greetings pastor Vance good to be here good to have you up here and uh Welcome to our vision discussion we love Vision I mean we've had discussion around Vision I think over the last decade so many times I don't know how many times it's our favorite part of the year I feel like it is our favorite part of the year and I think it's our favorite topic 100% to talk about why do you like talking about Vision it's how we met it is how we met we met around Vision right that's right I remember when you and Pastor Kira felt called from God and God gave you a vision for the Silicon Valley I don't know why you would leave the beaches of Australia because you've taken us there a couple times yes we did yes uh to land in Burling game you left Sydney beaches for Burling game I don't know but it was sacrifice that's right but I but I believe because it was God's Vision that he put in your life and uh you know that really uh allowed us to meet and that's why I love Vision so much I love it and really for us it was it was a it was the way we could live a radical faith that was our heart we wanted to live a a radical existence for God yeah we wanted to step out in a way that would challenge us that would create obviously had CL of stry but also a way we could live radical and that's why I wanted to read that passage of scripture about Shadrach Meshach and abedo because what we see with them is a three young men that lived a radical faith and you know the story the story is they did pay the consequences of not kneeling and not bowing they were thrown into the fire but God saved them but what I love about the story is even before the saving moment was the stand there it is they they chose to not bow to the idol and I love it because in choosing not to bow revealed what they stood for let me say it a little more poetic what they chose not to bow to revealed what they stood for that's powerful brilliant even though the consequences were very clear don't bow die yeah however they chose to not bow and in their not bow KN revealed that they stood for their God and I love it so much because while by no means was that an easy decision all right like if you're faced with the decision that if you do this you get death uh that's not an easy decision however hear me right when when I say this that while it wasn't easy it was simple it wasn't complicated it wasn't like okay if you don't bow and you do a headstand and you know a triple back flip then we know you no no it was just don't bow simple not easy but simple I want to quickly just uh maybe mention something about our friend Goram I was talking about Goram last week our church member in Istanbul Turkey who has been in and out of hospital had been attacked by her family for her faith and uh in a Muslim Nation where it's hostile to being a follower of Jesus Christ and we had been dialoguing back and forward with her friends who have been graciously caring with her standing with her she's been abandoned by her family and she has been an active member of our church for several years now and has been literally fighting for her life as she this last week was coming out of uh surgery uh and coming out of in pretty much being unconscious uh her friends had texted Pastor Lazelle asking Pastor Lazelle would you please persuade Goram to not say the name Jesus they were terrified that the moment she wakes up they know her she's going to say the name Jesus and it's going to put her in more danger and that were pleading with us and we could not do that we could not tell her to not profess the one name that could change everything the one name that could actually keep her safe the one name that could even use her story for amazing glory and so we couldn't do it and this week uh Pastor Lazelle got a message that I thought I would read to you because it actually ignites my faith when I read this the the testimony of our friend Goram who whose life is literally having incredible impact this was the the message m l this is from me and FMA we apologize for asking you to ask goam about not talking about Jesus we shouldn't have asked such a thing from you or her we know how much she loves Jesus please know that we asked something like this because we were worried about her but we shouldn't have asked today we understand better and we made a mistake we apologize we are very grateful to your God for healing Goram [Applause] again we went to the prayer room today and and thank you God for awakening the gorkum and asked him to heal her completely this is from Zarah as still trying to say thank you Jesus when we entered she took the phone and started a song even though she couldn't say the words she was trying to say them to be honest until today we didn't understand how singing could be a form of worship but when we saw Goram like that today we understood since the song was in English we could not understand song meaning at the time but when we went out we translated the lyrics of the song after this moment we realized how wrong we were by asking you and her not to talk about Jesus we apologize Church gom's Life is having an insurmountable effect come on just by trying to must the word Jesus I think about Shadrach mesach and ab bendo it wasn't easy but it was simple don't bow yeah for gum it's not easy it's dangerous but it's simple say Jesus I want to suggest in our Western setting it's reversed wow here it's easy but it's not simple it's easy to profess that you're a follower of Christ it's easy to say the name Jesus it's easy not to bow to the world there's no real repercussion for being a Believer here so therefore because it's easy I want to suggest it's not simple there is a different measure for us to live a radical Faith Like Goram like Shadrach like meach like abedo there is a different way that we have to live in order to possess a radical edgy Faith like we see modeled by people like Shadrach mesach abedo and Goram and I want to suggest that that's what Vision presents for US Vision presents us with an opportunity to live a radical fate that we would gear our finances in such a way way that would be contrary to the way the World Views finances the way the world builds their wealth the way the world gears their money in such a way that we would live differently where we would live a sacrificial life that builds a radical Faith to our existence that come on Dance is why we Center everything around Vision I love that I love that what you're proposing is that Vision gives us an opportunity to stand correct in our modern setting here in Mountain View in all of our locations that's what you propos to Kim and I over 11 years ago that's right right when I said Vision was really the reason that we got to meet The Story Goes that you and Pastor K had this vision for the Silicon Valley but didn't know many people in the Silicon Valley didn't know anybody didn't know anybody and we were lucky enough that you met us uh through a DM on on Twitter and I'm so thankful for that connection and I remember you moving um or actually actually taking a preview trip for the very first time and we were touring around I was at Google at the time uh Kim was teaching we were touring you around a little bit for a few hours at Google at Stanford and we ended up at a Thai restaurant I remember like it was yesterday that at that tie lunch you started declaring the vision that you had for Vive church that there was going to be a lifegiving church in the Silicon Valley that is going to minister to people that work at places like apple Facebook Google and these people that work at these companies that are building products that impact billions of people could they get a revelation of a God could they get a revelation of Jesus so they have deeper purpose for the products that they're building and could the Silicon Valley be known not just for technology and Innovation but could the Silicon Valley be known in the next decade for a move of God exactly and and and and transparently we were just trying to eat our pad tie but but something in that Vision compelled us something in that Vision captivated us and we saw our family be able to build around that vision and now we hundreds ofes do the same that they they CAU the call that they're now caring the vision Vision has a beginning yes in that Thai restaurant when there was no even building to be seen and that's what I like about vision is that sight is what you see when your eyes are open vision is what you see when your eyes are closed exactly so so so we so we have this imagination this Vision that you're casting it's always been Central to Vibe Church why has that been so important to you it's been so important and I think over the years didn't realize just how unique it was uh that I I thought that every uh Christian built their life around Vision that every church built their life around Vision you know I've come to realize that it is quite unique that maybe there is a lot of uh churches that just pass down through generation and so kind of easy to lose your weight yeah it's kind of easy to kind of just get focused on you know just existing for you and the few that you have that's right instead of wondering or thinking could there be a purpose in God's plan in assembling us together could there actually be a bigger plan that God has in mind in bringing a group of people together rather than being worshippers isolated but collectively together we could do something maybe much larger and more effective for the kingdom in being of one spirit being unified being of one Accord as the body of Believers and I think I realized really early on when we went from youth ministry to the strategy to move the Silicon Valley to be in the center of the world to a church that would impact the world we knew it would be very easy for Christians to be consumers yeah that's right it's true I think it's the default of every person is to think consumeristic because you were the most important person to you believe it or not and so your needs are Paramount in your life and so it's so easy to appropriate the church through a consumer uh perspective what does this church do for me what's this church going to provide for me what Ministries does it have what resources what how comfortable are the chairs how good is the preaching do I like the worship uh do I like the people that I have to spend time with everything is me me me me me Centric and that is a consumer Centric Christianity but Christians aren't meant to live consumer we're meant to live contributor God has called you if you were to follow Christ you are meant to live like Christ Jesus said I came to serve not be served so the whole orientation of the Christian up until you become a Christian it's meant to be about you but the moment you become a Christian it's not meant to be about you it's meant to be about how does God use me to influence others and the world around me right and so it's very easy uh it's very easy it's very easy to be a weak [Music] Christian weak Christianity is self-focused yeah it's true facts I don't think people want to hear that uh we CH we Christianity is living for yourself but that's not the orientation of the Christian the Christian lives selfless this is why Paul wrote in Galatians 2:20 it's no longer I that live but Christ that lives in me therefore this life I now live in the body is lived in the spirit for Christ it's not a my orientation has changed the moment I realized the grace of God to forgive me of my sins I realize that he died for me he purchased my life therefore my life done belong to me so I don't get to live my life for me I live my life to serve Jesus Christ first and foremost and to serve the body of Christ secondary and that is the orientation of what it actually takes to live a base level radical Faith that's what I think I love it so you're saying our giving is not a subscription no it's not a subscription right oh like a subscription like I paid now what do I get consumer mentality right that that that are GI giving is not positioned as a subscription because the church is not built off subscriptions exactly the church is built on sacrifice exactly the the the collective sacrifice of the Saints yes and so you know I've seen this and this is so cool God is so kind because as we get this revelation of what a Christian is a Christian sacrifices so that a Christian can serve the Bible verse that talks about how as you refresh others you yourself get refreshed correct so true Kim and I have seen it in our lives and I've seen it in dozens and hundreds of families at Vive church now I see the odms I see the alesco I see the McDonald's our our lives have expanded and accelerated because of the collective Vision that we have of as a church yes but it's also individually blessed us as families why do you think it works that way well Vision gives you a Direction with that direction you have no momentum see see you can you can get in your car and you can just push Accel accelerated down and you might just go nowhere but Vision actually gives you a direction that all of a sudden you can get a propulsion behind you and actually make some ground you actually take some ground I'll give you two scriptures here in Proverbs 29:18 it says where there is no vision the people perish so sometimes we think vision is unique uh to Vive church but Vision should be the standard for every saint that's it every Christian lives should live with vision because without Vision should be the abnormal state to to not have a vision because the absence of vision means that you're perishing that you're actually perishing you're burning robber you you you're doing energy for no reason going nowhere there's no momentum behind your life that's why I can talk to people all the time and maybe you have two uh but I talk to people and I've I've never ever in my life and I've been doing Ministry for a long time Vance you know this I have never talked to someone who tithe or given to vision and said and they've never said oh I hate it right we don't meet regretful generous people never I've never met somebody and said you know what Pastor I just hate tithing I really don't like honoring God with the first tenth of my in my income I really hate going to sleep every night knowing I'm wasting so much money on God nobody has ever said that to me it's true what I have got is people saying I'm so thankful that I've got a reason for building I'm so thankful that I've got a reason to direct my finances and build my company and and I'm so glad I can sit in my bed at night and close my eyes knowing that I'm building the kingdom of God I'm being obedient I'm putting the principles of the Bible in place in my life and and that's what Vision does vision gives us perspective it stops US perishing otherwise I have spoken to people though however who have spoken to me about I I get promotions and I get job opportunities but I make no ground I feel like I spend more I make more and I spend more feel like I'm going nowhere it's that lack of moment momentum because I got no vision to what I'm doing another passage uh habac 2:2 write the vision make it plain on tablets so he may run who reads it so once I get Vision I got Direction that's What vision is for without Vision you are you are subject to Greed there's the potential for greed cuz without Vision I got no Direction so so so so I have the potential to hoard and store everything I get we we preach this at T at Vive church that greed doesn't come from getting greed is not from getting greed is from not giving that's it greed isn't determined by how much you get greed is determined by how little you give so good it's good I thought this discussion would go down well it feels like it's a little tense they're taking notes no but like I mean you can earn a little and still be greedy it's true if there's no flow out of your life if there's no people you're blessing and no generosity in your life you can earn a lot and be greedy because you're hoarding it sometimes greed actually gets you fearful around finances because finances is your security and you can never be secure enough wow You'll never have enough but what great security it is to know that my finances aren't dictated by me my Supply is God that he's got everything in control doesn't matter what the economy is doing so as I release I actually release the grip of greed on my life too and vision gives us that direction on where to direct our finances love we don't meet regretful generous people ever no but we do meet regretful stingy people all the time all the time because Vision elevates yes your life yes Vision elevates the conversation I love that we don't manipulate people in money because we don't we don't give out of need correct the church is not needy nope we we always elevate it to Vision well God has no needs m and and sometimes we can actually apply this not just into giving we we apply this into worship yeah like a really poor perspective of worship is that all right I better turn up to church because God needs my worship God doesn't need worship he doesn't have an identity uh disorder he knows he's God his godliness isn't dependent on your worship or you reminding him that he's God God's not needy God's not sulking all week long waiting for Sunday just so the church will show up and give him praise no no God is God is God he has no needs he was God before you were around he made you God is God God doesn't need worship you need worship because you need to elevate your perspective you need to magnify God over your situation because your situation is trying to elevate itself over you so so there is no needs that God has that we can meet so we don't serve a needy God and that can be confusing when you come to a setting like this right where I'm sure that maybe if you've come in the last year that we've been in this building and you've missed the previous 10 years where we've been you know building is sacrificially popping up you know packing down on Sunday and rented spaces it's easy I know and I've heard people wow man look at look at it looks like we don't have any needs that's a poor perspective of Christianity that that we just live needy no no no cuz needy people can't help anybody God wants you to be blessed so you can be a blessing and the reason that God wants to bless his church and bless his house so that we can advance his kingdom into regions where when're not yet see you don't get rewards just Pro for providing for needs all right let me break this down C can I offend some people yeah come on wouldn't wouldn't really be doing my job if I didn't um there's a verse in the Bible that's right in the good part of the Bible too like in second Corinthians Paul's that's the good part that's not even the part that's hard to preach it's easy to preach and in 2 Corinthians 5 Paul Paul shares this thing hey so Church walk by faith and not by sight and we love that like that verse is like catnip for Christians I'm telling you we love that verse like walk by faith not by sight love it we'll preach that and we'll preach that and you'll say amen and we love that verse but what we don't like is a couple of verses later in verse uh 10 where he says this he he says this 2 Corinthians 5:10 I want to read it to you if you dare if you don't want to hear this close your ear CU most Christians don't want to hear this verse but it's right in the good part of the Bible too Paul says this for we must all stand before Christ to be judged we will each receive whatever we deserve for the good or evil we have done for what we do in this Earthly body Romans 1410 says a similar thing but you probably haven't heard that preached either and the reason we don't like that preach is because it it takes this concept of living by faith as having a result now what Paul is not suggesting is that somehow we're responsible for what we do to get Faith because you can't do anything to reserve Grace that's what he did but what Paul is saying it's on the other side of your faith yes that we will in eternity and we don't like to think of Eternity too much but in eternity we we'll stand before God and we will be judged for what we've done not for Faith but what we've done with faith wow what was the purpose of you having faith what was the purpose to your faith is what Jesus will literally ask he will ask what you had Faith what' you do with it I had big plans I wanted you to advance the kingdom I want to part but what did you do with your faith and and I think that that is like a it's like a sticky topic that that God expects us to put our faith to work oh yeah 100% And I feel like the danger sometimes is when you say that and when you teach that people could have have the perspective of Okay cool so what's VI staff going to do well we hear that all the time actually what's that thing that I love when people ask they ask um I'd love to know how the church manages finances and I love that question because I always want to ask the question back we talked about this um do you mean our finance department or are you talking about you the church are you disassociating yourself from the church and say how does everyone else here manage their finances or are you asking how do we the church cuz we are the church so when we say how do we manage our finances let's look at a report you give a report every year yeah we give uh an annual report especially at the gala we break it down we show pie charts on how money is allocated as you give to the church how it moves through the church for the mission of Jesus Christ it would be so funny though right what you're saying is a challenging thought cuz what if then we turn it back and said okay everybody now share your personal pie chart right so imagine that that would be fun who's in I'm in I'm in I'm I'm down like let's all just do a little pie chart of how we how we budgeted this year how we spent our finances how much went to Netflix uh how much went to whatever else you know all the things that we do but that fun what a good challenging question because we're we're it's tongue and cheek a little bit but isn't it a good example of Are We honoring God exactly what we be proud of our personal pie chart are we honoring him with the tithe are we participating in Kingdom advancement through vision giving or because the thing is your personal pie chart for sure represents a lot of things it definitely represents Starbucks right it represents Netflix it represents your iPhone it represents Apple it represents Disney it represents booking.com it represents Marriott it represents Airbnb and whether you know it or not all of these brands are kingdoms correct and so if your pie chart represents those kingdoms but not the kingdom first right so it's just it's a challenging thought but it's a good thought and I that's why I love Vision because Vision reorients us it realigns us the Bible says seek first the kingdom we're not against those Brands especially when you're transacting and purchasing from brands that are pursuing Excellence I believe that's of God but are you putting the kingdom first so good I mean it's it's it's Kingdom building right and I think that what we've had in the church in history is we've had a subset of Kingdom Builders wow individual families that uh don't just give of their tithe they give sacrificially to build the vision break that down because I don't know if everybody understands the delineation especially if you're newer Tov okay let me break that down let me finish this thought first because I feel like while we've had a subset of Kingdom Builders in the church it's almost like being like a Ministry I think every Christian should be a kingdom Builder amen I think it should be a subset of Christians carrying the load of advancing the kingdom I think every Christian should be Kingdom Builder but but but there is a difference between the tithe and you may be new so let me just break it down as simply as I possibly can for you that that there is a a the Bible talks about the principle of the tithe the first 10% bring your tithe into the storehouse so there may be food in my house now I need to break this down because I know what it can be like I know what it feels like to to not understand where the tithe goes cuzz when I was growing up in church I definitely thought thought that cuz they would say hey we send this to God I thought there was like a little Shute or something that we sent up to heaven and I was four okay you're 40 all right so um um so so so what you need to know is that the tithe represents a tenth of our income it goes to the function and the operation of building the church it goes to paying the bills the electricity the supply all the things that provide Ministry and all the things that we do as the body it outreaches into our community it it facilitates the the function of the church the operations Kingdom advancement actually is with vision so it's the areas of how we expand the kingdom into new territories new regions new opportunities that doesn't come out of the tithe that goes to making sure we have a church the vision is above and beyond the tithe that's why it doesn't make sense just to go oh I love the vision Pastor I took my tithe and I put it to the vision no I mean I'm not on the finance team but I know how that does doesn't work okay so so the truth of the matter is you have the tithe which is our duty to honor God but the vision is our opportunity to advance the kingdom they're two different things your tithe honors God and how good is God he just says hey you know what I'm going to make it really easy for you to honor me just give a tenth is that it a tenth I mean that's that's pretty low level in my mind but God's like hey that's just all I'm going to ask I'm going give you a little hurdle 10% honors me but above your tithe is how you get to build the kingdom I love that I love this conversation on Vision I'm growing in my conviction around Vision even further you know vision is important we've read that without it we perish right so it's not even neutral yes but why at Vive is the vision so big you you you've printed it on our wall it's a 50-year vision that you wrote in 2018 and it is so big like why why did you decide to make it that big well I didn't decide God did but um look honestly I think the vision has to be big so that it requires all of us to do it that that's the goal and that's why we don't I don't believe in a Ministry of Kingdom Builders I think every believer should be a kingdom oriented Builder meaning how do I gear my life in such a radical way that I want to build the kingdom of God not build my own thing but it's so big that it's going to require all of us together now we break it down each year year 50 years and it's also a vision that's going to outlive us that's going to get Beyond ours to the Next Generation can pick up that mantle and extend the vision but but ultimately it's got to be big so that it can't be done alone oh I love that that because that's not the kingdom order is just Mavericks random people doing their own thing because there is that actually can create chaos and disunity rather than God calling us all together and what's really cool is it gives you permission to do what you do daily and and and use it for building the kingdom now you might be thinking all right I'm an engineer I code all day long how is that building the kingdom cool I'm glad you asked because if tomorrow you jump on a flight and you go to Germany and you start preaching the gospel I'm pretty sure you're gonna have a limited effect yeah probably because you don't speak German for starters but I also don't know how good you are we're preaching the gospel however if henk and Bey start coming to Google and start coding for you guess what they're not going to be very good because they can't engineer anything all right however God allows us to do what we do and as we partner together all in our parts we actually all Advance the gospel together we advance the kingdom together so even your coding now you have purpose and direction to your building of your product as an educator as an administrator as a police officer whatever you do you have a focused way to now go what I do as an expert in my field I'm Building Wealth and as I sacrifice that wealth in giving to the vision I'm partnering with those that are actually on the front line preaching the gospel or in the mission team in Brazil I'm part of the Miracles that they see and the Breakthrough they see even though I'm doing my daily job I'm part of that and that's how we do it together it's incredible that's why it requires a big Vision yeah the last decade it it's been expansion on the other side side of vision yes right every single year as you've broken down that 50-year Vision into each part every single year we've seen campuses planted that's why we have over 10 locations uh even what you were talking about today with Goram we reached through through a vision element called Vive online that was a vision element that was started Vive worship which we all enjoyed today that has now gone Global that was a vision element and so really I feel like since Vision Sunday just a few weeks ago we've even even transitioned cuz God is so good we're about to reach the amount yeah we're close we're like we're like at 4.3 million committed of 4.5 so 4.5 is the goal for us to achieve everything that we've got this year in the vision we've calculated we're going to require about 4.5 million we're at 4 three which is great it's incredible we're close um and most people would generally clap for that but that's fine this 1130 is hard to impress um I get excited about that but I I would reserve my clapping too because you know then by now that our goal is not even the amount exactly our goal is the participation what we have proven here at five church year and year is even if we didn't hit the amount we're still going to achieve the vision in some way we just I've seen the finance department work miracles and and and I know that God will provide in different ways so it's not the amount it's the participation that's it I care more about every single person partnering with the vision I care more about every single family representing and and and it's not just about getting an amount from few and saying well look what we did like you're the the critics anybody ever see the Muppets and you got the two cranky guys who are always skeptical like criticizing everything that they do on stage that's how the church can look sometimes it's true or hey look what we did could have done better but not contributing to anything just criticizing everything that becomes toxic to a church the way to stop being being a Critic of the church is start being a contributor to the church come on saying hey there's a vision I'm in even if it doesn't seem like it's a significant level it's not equal giving it's equal sacrifice I've over the last couple weeks I've sat with families who are in a tough Financial season in their own family life but have said pastor we're going to stretch by faith regardless even though we need we're going to give and they've partnered with $1,000 over the next 12 months they don't even know how that ,000 is going to come in but I'm so excited to pray with them and believe that God is going to supply $1,000 in some fashion over the next year so that they can partner with that Vision commitment and it's just as exciting to me as the person the business leader that's committing $500,000 over the next year both are stretching by faith both are giving sacrificially and both evenly to a measure that they have it's like the Widow's might why Jesus when she came and she brought this two widows might and and he said she's given more that's it and the disciples are like um okay we know that's not much but he emphasized compared to what she has it was everything and that's the participation that's it it's not about the amount no it's about the buying it's about saying hey I'm in it's my church I'm a part of the Kingdom I'm going to build the kingdom I'm gonna I'm going to sacrifice and to to be in a community of faith and not participate that's concerning to me wow the concerning factor to me is like where's your heart hardened instead of your heart being fortified we're going to fortify our heart in this generation come on to strengthen our hearts true to say man I'm going to be fortified in my faith but too many people got hardened Hearts not fortified Hearts where your heart becom becomes callous so you sit there and think that everything's for the person next to you or the person in the row and excuse yourself from the call of God the mission of God is with your name on it yeah it's with your name on it radical Faith isn't just for the select few no God calls us all to live a radical faith and this is Vision to to it I'm guarantee you it's probably crazy I got a family just like yours extended family cousins Aunts Uncles parents and and I know what it's like when they see how much money we give to the kingdom of God and how much we Orient our finances towards build I know the crazy conversations that we have as well but they know what I stand for I love that it's really clear it's clear to my neighbors it's clear to my family what I stand for and it's not what I preach no it's where I spend it's exactly where I direct my finances that speak loudest in my life and when you're part of the miracle the miracle hits different different see see those that stood and gave towards this building when they walk in the building hits different oh yeah I see people picking up trash cuz it's their place ownership I see people who gave to the vision they're cleaning stuff cuz they're like hey this is my building it's incredible when people don't they just walk in they leave their Starbucks around it's a different way it's different and I'm not I feel like I'm coming across judge you but I'm just trying to give you the perspective of ownership how everything shifts the moment you just I'm partnering with this I'm participating in this everything's different you see everything different and we find ourselves in a season well we're going to believe again we're believeing again we're believing for more miracles in 2024 you presented it just a few weeks ago but maybe some people are just coming in and and they haven't even even heard the vision or maybe they haven't heard the vision in a conversational format with you on a one-on-one basis so maybe let's open up that conversation really quick in 5 minutes can we just refresh ourselves on the vision the vision elements yeah yeah let's talk about that because we have a specific Vision in the 50-year vision we've really kind of from the prayer Retreat figured out that these are the areas that we want to focus on this she yes what do you want to start build anyway I'm really excited about that God gave you this insight into the market really yeah I mean we we've been assessing the market for a while the economy and a lot of the job losses and the inflation and and and really I think it's just caused a crazy effect on how people can give and how much I would say uh fluidity there is to finances and all that kind of stuff", " however at the same time we're seeing the market of commercial real estate and Retail spaces plummeting in cities like San Francisco and Oakland now to me that tells me this is an opportunity that in areas where it was almost impossible to ever think that we could own buildings for the retail price on what it cost to purchase buildings in these cities now it's possible and we could have permanent locations like this one in several cities like Oakland and uh in San Francisco and San Jose and and I get excited for the opportunity that we have in this season while the Market's down as we sacrifice we can be in a position to put a down payment on these buildings so we're going for properties and locations but we're also going to invest in our current locations through Kingdom of Light Building out Ro kids industry state-ofthe-art technology I don't know how many of you grew up in a Pentecostal Church you would remember a felt board right yeah you remember felt board that was cutting Ed technology back then especially for us homeschool kids uh anyway I wasn't homeschooled but but regardless uh I I think in our day and age we need to be on the Forefront of Technology making sure that we teach Kingdom principles through technology and drawing out the best ministers that are to come and so we want to enhance that reach our community all that kind of stuff I love that the the church is not just in the four walls but it's also outside so we're also investing in Hope houses oh man I am so pumped about this maybe I need to clarify this too we launched hope hanger last year and the effect that we've been having through hope hanger situated here in feeding our community our pantry food clothed Pantry just on Monday night we had our turkey giveaway and we had over 500 families lined up around the parking lot receiving turkeys so that they could have a Thanksgiving dinner in their homes we actually ran out of turkeys and uh we still had I think it was like 50 families that were still waiting so we just we couldn't let them go home turkeyless so we just ran to to Costco and we bought more turkeys and every family uh went home with a turkey for Thanksgiving and that's the church now we're expanding that and something that's been on our heart for a long time has been hope houses where we can have really a Ministry for atrisk women for women who have been products of abuse who have got children who are deciding not to uh abort their children or put their children they want to they want to Mother their children and we want to be able to put them in a home where we can house them teach them care for them give them School sets and rehabilitate them to get get them in their life and on their own two feet so we have not just partnered with an organization called New Creation homes we've actually acquired them they have actually decided that they want to come under the banner of Hope hanger which is a strategic move so we now have two homes in East paloalto that have essentially been gifted to the church this ministry's been running for years a very fruitful Ministry and what that's going to allow us to do is to keep increasing the amount of homes that we have in cities like Oakland around the Bay Area for atrisk women which would be great you have a vision that hope goes Global goes Global that's the idea is that it's not just here in Mountain View but it's around the globe and all our locations and cities where we keep planning churches around the globe brilliant I would love to be one of the most prominent names in serving Charities and crisis situations and all that kind of stuff that hope hanger is a is is a well-known name we're going to be foots on the ground even with missions that we talked about so we're going to go anyway next year double down on missions double down on missions eight as I said before and um you should consider being a part of one for sure and then you know we have incredible leaders leading these initiatives but candidly we're starting to get to capacity with our leadership and so we need to grow one of my one of my favorite elements of the vision this year is our ministry apprenticeship we are putting apprentices and interns uh into the mission field to train them uh I just see uh kids young people graduating high school instead of maybe going into doing engineering or accounting or or law but becoming experts in Ministry getting straight on the mission field training on how to be ministers Church planners and I'm telling you maybe in the next few years we're going to see the best and most effective Church planners that we've ever seen go out not just people who go well I can't do anything else I might as well build a church no no actually expert trained ministers who are equipped with preaching ministering building leading out there building the churches of the future we're going to need that cuz it seems like we we are planting churches every single year and we're not stopping cuz we're going to plant anyway in 2024 we're going to plant two more what's really cool is we're planting a church in Moder in Italy but but what's really cool and if you haven't heard this is our Italian churches are doing that one they're literally looking after that one themselves they're funding it and I don't expect you to be excited because I don't expect you to be an expert on foreign economy but the economy in Italy is pretty broke however our church is so generous that they are giving above and beyond their income many of our church congreg have two jobs by the way just to be able to survive in Italy but they are giving so sacrificially we're going to launch a new a new church in Italy as well as launch hope hangers um but we're also going to launch in Frankfurt Germany with uh pastor henck and Pastor Bey and I'm so excited just for the expert builders that God has gifted Us in this couple they are prolific evangelists already uh Pastor hen's been on tour with a youth movement recently seeing thousands of people at the Holy Spirit nights and uh I I know that we are going to have a strong Church in in Germany that isn't just about holding services but is about changing the culture in the country of Germany and Beyond I love the vision I love this Vision because it's what Christians do it's what Vive does yes Christians we like we said in this conversation we sacrifice Christians serve because we model Jesus and we have an opportunity to stretch again yes so that we can stand I love that like Shadrach meach a Bendigo like gorcum when we sacrifice that's our stand when we give that's our stand it's easy to be a Christian in the United States of America in the Silicon Valley it's difficult to make a stand that's not so simple because it requires a sacrifice of finances that sometimes is the most precious thing to us that's right Jesus said show me a treasure show you where hot is costs us something but that's how we live a radical faith in our modern day is we say you know what I'm going to gear my finances to live sacrificially to build his kingdom that's my stand and so we want to make sure that the vision as our last week we going to have this discussion so you do not miss the opportunity to make your stand and for you to partner with the vision and say I'm going to have a radical Faith this year we' got the QR codes up there it's an easy little link to to partner with the vision in some level we don't give you a level we don't tell you what it looks like financially to do it we let that be between you and the Holy Spirit and you get to have that dialogue that's the cool thing about it you get to actually dialogue with God and and ask God how do you want me to build the kingdom this year and uh I want to pray a blessing on us as a church as we enter out of vision season and we now go into implementation season we've been in raising season we've been raising the finances for the vision as of this next week we're now implementing the vision and we're going to make it happen and I don't don't want you to miss out on this on this final week you don't have to have the money you can just get a give a pledge and say I'm I'm going to believe miraculously this is going to come in that's how we do it but why don't we stand right now in the presence of God and I want to pray over you for those that are going to say I'm partnering with div Vision God I pray right now a blessing on those that have already partnered and those that are deciding to partner Lord would you bless them would you accelerate Lord our lives in such a way where we would see increase so that we can stretch even more that we can have even more effect God we know there is more with you that we know there's more you want to do and God we want to be the ones to fulfill it would you partner with us God would you increase our bonds so that we can do more in your kingdom and Advance your purpose so God I pray a blessing on each and every person today cuz God we want to live for you we want all that you have and if there's more we want it [Music]", "hey welcome to the vibe Church podcast I am so glad that you found us I trust that what God brings into your life today through this word is going to bless you expand you and grow you as a result I pray that God equips you I pray that God mobilizes you after hearing this word enjoy welcome to Vision Sunday happy Vision Sunday what a great day to be in the house of the Lord today if you're new to Vive church I am so glad that you chose today to be your first immersion into Vive Church you picked a good one because today we're going around vision and if you've been here for a minute at Vive church you've been here for a year or more you would know each and every year we dedicate this weekend to focus on Vision to get our direction from God and what he is calling us to as a global Church in fact talking about a global church can we welcome all our Global campuses joining us right now from San Jose to Oakland to San Francisco Honolulu Chicago Rome Milan London my goodness and every other location that you find yourself in it is so good to be one Church the body of Christ The Community of Faith leaning into what God has for us expectant that'd be my prayer that that you would be expectant today that you would have this expectation and I I feel the tension I don't know if you feel the tension right now but I feel the tension it's that it's that tension between knowing that God's got something for us as a church but at the same time knowing what God's got he's going to ask me to do it wouldn't it be nice if just if if God just revealed what he was going to do and you got to watch I hate to tell you this that ain't the way God works there ain't no spectator sport in the kingdom of God God says I want to partner with you I want you to participate so as big as the vision is you can know that God's going to ask something of of of you and I'm excited to see how how God expands us how he increases our capacity in the process of stretching toward the vision that God has for it it's going to be a stretch but you better for it amen amen if you ever lifted a weight you know there's a stretch but you better for it in the name of Jesus Amen well I'm excited because I know that today it's going to be a little bit different I'm going to reveal some of the vision elements that we are specifically going to unpack around our future letter our vision letter that we've been unpacking for the last several years and will be for the next 50 years but I'm going to reveal a few elements that are going to make what is in the future a reality as we partner together with God today but before I get to that I I do want to preach the word of God it is Sunday after all it's Vision Sunday and Sundays we preach we come around the word of the Living God and we preach the word of God we get it into our souls so that we can carry it out into our world so before we come around the vision just for a moment as as we stay standing would you open your Bibles to the Book of Daniel it's where we're going to find ourselves I want to use this story this passage of scripture to set the scene for God to speak to us today and and I truly believe that there are some elements from the life of Daniel that that I think God is wanting to either deepen or develop in us as a church so let me go ahead and read from Daniel chapter 6 and bear with me I want to kind of set the scene so I need to read the chapter in verse one it says it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 110 20 sat traps to be throughout the whole Kingdom and over them three High officials of whom Daniel was one to whom those sat traps should give account so that the king might suffer no loss then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other high officials and sat traps because an excellent Spirit was in him and the King planned to set him over the whole Kingdom then the high officials in the SAT trap s to find ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault because he was faithful and no error or fault was found in him these men said we shall not find any ground for complaint against Daniel unless we find it in connection with the Lord of his God then these high officials and sat traps came by agreement to the king and said to him oh King Darius live forever all the high officials of the Kingdom the prefects and the satraps and the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and Force an injunction that whoever makes a petition to God or man for 30 days except To You O King shall be cast in The Den of Lions now O King establish the injunction and sign the document so that it cannot be changed according to the law of the mes and the Persians which cannot be revoked therefore King Darius signed the document and the injunction verse 10 when Daniel when Daniel knew that the document had been signed he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem he got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he had done previously I want want to keep it simple and as expected I want to preach to you today from the subject anyway anyway are you ready for the word of God today all right as you prepare your hearts find six of your favorite Folk around you and just give them a high five go ahead come on Oak toown Let's Go San Jose San Francisco let's go let's go highfive them get ready anyway anyway you ever done something anyway usually means you did something you weren't meant to do but you did it anyway you did something dangerous it was dangerous but you did it anyway a few years ago kir and I were in Mexico celebrating our anniversary we take an anniversary trip each and every year because we feel like our marriage deserves celebrating and so we like to go to a special place we take it for the same week every year and you cannot contact us on that week we're celebrating marriage and uh a couple years ago we were in Mexico and I was particularly excited about this Resort that we were going to because a part of the perks of the resort is you got a pair of bicycles with your room was assigned to your room and I was I was excited because we could go riding around the resort and Cancun and we could do a whole bunch of stuff and and I was really pumped but but when we turned up to the room we checked in and and and as we turned up to the room there were no bikes and I thought you know what it's okay they probably they probably come and do like a little ceremony or something you know they probably knock on the door and say you know Mr and Mrs smokum here uh your bicycles for the week please enjoy but but the whole night went past the whole next day and still no bikes and we're watching folk riding there their bikes around in Bliss Honeymooners on their bikes and I'm like this is not this is not right they're brand new married we've been married 10 years at the time I said they they might even make it and they get bikes we we we've been going 10 years at this we deserve bikes there were no bikes I was getting frustrated because I was missing out on what was rightfully mine with the booking of the hotel and I remember we came out of lunch one time out of the out of the restaurant and I saw some bikes just sitting there I said babe there's our bikes she said they ain't our bikes and I said well whose bikes are they she said there's somebody's I said no they're the resorts bikes so therefore they're rightfully our bikes now now in our relationship kir is what is known as what is the rule follower every relationship has one figure out which one you are okay kir is the rule abider so she is protesting the fact that if we take those bikes somebody else won't have bikes but I'm like babe we've already had no bikes we've been doing this for 10 years it's time we we get our reward and so I just did I said I'm doing it anyway so I went and jumped on the bike and we took off and we're riding up the up the bridge and we're riding up the street and I'm like look at our bikes I look around and Kira is not there I'm like where where'd Kira go so I turn around and I'm like now I'm going back to the scene of crime which you never do by the way just in case you feel like committing a crime uh anyway I go back to the scene and there's Kira literally Frozen she's Frozen she the rule about it doesn't know what to do she like have an aneurysm or something she like what do I do and I'm like babe let's let's go let's go this is a bnny and Clyde moment let's do this it's so romantic and so she's like ah and she just jumps on the bike and we start pedaling away we had the best time on the bikes we rode down in the mangroves we went down to the beach we we had a whole day on the bikes we had so much fun I forgot I stole them and parked them at our hotel room and I didn't realize they had ID numbers on each bike that was assigned to specific guest next thing we get a knock on our hotel room sir did you steal bikes anyway doesn't matter you know what I love about Daniel Daniel's an anyway kind of guy in fact what I love about the Book of Daniel is the magnitude of the Miracles that we find from the fiery furnace to the floating handwriting on the wall to the Lion's Den these not only make for epic kids church stories but they frame for us the way that God works and wants to work in our lives you see something that I want us to understand at a deep level is that we serve a god of the miraculous we serve a god of the miraculous a god of great power a God who performs Mighty works and as we carry out the mission of extending his kingdom through Awakening people to the reality of Jesus and bringing to Heaven to Earth we actually become candidates of his great power the kind of people that God wants to partner with what we find in Daniel is not only magnificent Miracles but a particular dynamic or characteristic to Daniel that that ultimately made him or positioned him as the person that God chose to throw his throw his power through there something about Daniel out of all the people he could have choose there was something about Daniel that made him the candidate through which God used and directed his power and I want you to know that God is still certainly looking for people to partner with through through who he can reveal his power today and before I share the vision elements and we're going to get to that for this year I want to map out three characteristics of what I would consider as a candidate for those God uses for those that God is going to select and he is looking the Bible makes it clear he's searching for for those he can partner with those who who who he can put his power into and not just give his power to but who he can flow his power through and there are some characteristics that make you a candidate for that person to be that person who God chooses and I want to give it to you in the first first one being you might want to write this down is disciplined I know that's not super sexy but it's true disciplined Daniel was disciplined he had dedicated his life to God and disciplined his life in such a way that it revealed in Scripture that he had what was called an excellent spirit in fact despite being an exile Daniel was more distinguished than anyone else in the entire nation of Babylon because he was faithful and the Bible says without fault this was because Daniel's life was centered on God his life was built on God and the way he viewed the world was drenched with God in fact even the way Daniel presents the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar at the start of his book Reveals His understanding around the fact that God is still in control see he doesn't start his book in Daniel by saying well King Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem and therefore overtook it no he says that King Nebuchadnezzar came up against Jerusalem and God handed over jeim to Nebuchadnezzar he said God handed him over Daniel's perspective was that that that the enemy didn't take anything God gave it see this is the Revelation with Jesus too Jesus said they can't take my life I already lay it down you get the power of that perspective as well you ever had something stolen from you someone stole your wallet a good thing to do is go no I give it takes a sting out of it a little bit but can't can't take something that was given this is what frustrated the enemy when Jesus went to the cross the enemy thought he was taking his life Jesus said I laid down my life took the thing out of death because it was a given sacrifice it wasn't something that was stolen this was Daniel's perspective when it came to Israel being in in Exile he realized that it wasn't taken God laid it because maybe God was wanting to do something through it just maybe God was trying to set something up and because of Daniel's discipline he was now positioned a place of prominence within that exalt society and it's much as we want God to perform magnificent signs and wonders it's it's actually most of the time it's the it's the little day-to-day disciplines that serve as the greatest signs did you know that like we want God to do big Miracles that are a great sign towards God but I want to suggest that it's the little disciplines that you possess as a believer that are the greatest signs of God and I've talked about this recently but God will often use signs throughout scripture a sign is it's a Mark or a moment that reminds us that God is with us and reveals that his will is still at work in our life and we see it with the plagues in Egypt or we also see it with the burning bush the Old Testament reveals or uses signs to to reveal God or direct his people Jesus also used signs I love it when he was recruiting the disciples he went to Peter and John and they were fishing and they were catching nothing all night and he said hey throw your net on the other side they did it out of obedience even though they were the professional fisherman and Jesus was just the carpenter but they did it regardless and they you know the story they get a great catch but instead of Jesus reiterating that they're great fishermen he used it as a sign to how they will be fishes for men and so Jesus used signs signs to be representative let me take it one step further because the way you live as a Believer is meant to be a sign Philippians 1:28 talks about the Christian Living confidently it says don't be intimidated in any way by your enemies this will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed but that you are going to be saved even by God himself so so the moment you keep as a Christian freaking out when when the world's chaotic you you're actually being a bad sign when you jump on your Facebook machine and all of a sudden you start Facebooking about about all the ideologies that are out there and all the things that are attacking the Christian faith and you start freaking out online you don't look courageous you look weak but the fact that you have peace when the world is at chaos the fact that you have faith in God that he will prevail and that you stay courageous that is a sign to the world while while thou be destroyed you'll be saved even by God himself see the Pharisees always wanted a sign from Jesus they would often demand Jesus show us a sign but Jesus refused to give them a sign because he was trying to reveal to them that instead of showing them a sign he wanted them to be be a sign he wanted them to be a sign that God is greater than the chaos of the world that the kingdom that they were a part of was better than the desperate Kingdom that they were trying to establish on Earth and he wanted to wanted the Believers to be the sign on the earth that the way you have peace and the way you have courage and the way you have confidence reveals that you're a signpost of a great God kep they kept kept asking for sign and so the mere Act of living a life of discipline is actually a sign of someone who strong secure and sented on God I actually want to suggest that it was Daniel's discipline that allowed him to be daring that's the second characteristic if you want to write that down it's his discipline that allowed him to be daring because he was a man of integrity and he had no fault he was able to be bold and do daring things did you know daring is Faith in practice you you you can't put Faith in safety see he was daring he dared to speak on behalf of God he dared to interpret dreams he dared to believe that God would do what he had promised in fact living by faith is living daring if you don't live by faith the default is lived by fear and and you want to live by fear do nothing it'll come you'll be afraid of everything and anything you'll literally live afraid day to day you'll just take The Narrative of the world you'll take the situations you see around you you'll look you'll live by sight and not by faith and fear will be the byproduct of living that way but if you want to live by faith you'll begin to live a daring life and you dare to believe that God can create something from nothing you'll dare to believe that God has a different way in mind you you'll dare to believe that what's ahead of you is better than what's behind you that God can turn things around that's what you're dared to believe so living by faith is living daring living by fear means doing nothing it's the fault the truth is we're meant to live by faith which is in the realm of Wonder God works in signs and wonders you see wonders are are the wondrous works of God that means he carries out his miraculous Works throughout Creation in wondrous ways now with Moses while the plagues of Egypt and the burning bush were a sign The Parting of the Red Sea was a wonder it was a Wonder because no one could imagine that that was the way that God was going to do it no one no one foresee could foresee that that was the way that your back was up against the wall but God was going to part the wall no one could see that coming but that's what his Wonder does it it reveals the ways that God has of doing things what Reveals His omnipotence his his Almighty power in fact in the Book of Daniel we find that King Nebuchadnezzar had a firsthand experience with the Wonder of God after he tried to put Dan Shadrach Meshach and ab to go in the fire and it didn't work and they didn't get burned and they come out like fine and he's like yo and he writes this I want you all to know he's talking to the whole world at this point the miraculous signs and wonders the most high God has performed for me how great are his signs how powerful are his wonders in fact maybe we could just stay in the Book of Daniel just because this book holds for me I I would consider one of the most incredible wonders of God in in the story of Daniel and the lion Den how many of you all have heard this story you've been to kids church you've done the feltboard anybody anybody old school enough to be in the feltboard kids church era of the 1980s in the 1980s we didn't have digital devices the the the Forefront of Technology was a felt board you had a felt board and you had a felt lion and you had a felt pit and you had a felt Daniel and you would play out the story of Daniel and the Lion's Den and as furry as that boy was it was still ferocious because you could see that Daniel was in the den with lions and and if I'm Daniel and I'm thinking I'm up against the situation I could foresee that maybe in the last minute before I get lowered into the pit something comes through and saves me maybe a superhero because people love Marvel these days you know there's like these ways that you have in mind that you can make up and get creative and make up superpowers and stuff but no one would have thought that God would caus the lion's mouth to be clenched shut that I didn't see that coming but God has ways God has ways and I love it because I want to read this we see that Daniel had been the byproduct of a scheme to try and get him out and King Darius had been tricked himself into passing a law that Pro prevented anyone from praying to a god other than the king himself for 30 days and as I read this I can't help but think Daniel what are you doing like Daniel could have certainly prayed under to cover you think about it he's in Exile but he's been disciplined he's been diligent to pray and all that time he's been praying and diligent and without fault he's found himself in a place of prominence which just sounds like God doesn't it it just sounds like God like God would do such a thing he would take you into a foreign land captive he would hand over the kingdom to the enemy just so that he could put you into a position of power so that at the right time for a Time such as as this Esther that you would be positioned to preach and see a whole nation saved and now you've got a little hiccup because the next 30 days you could easily you could easily excuse yourself well devil you won't devil ain't going to take what God has for me I'll just shut my windows and I'll just pray in secret for 30 just 30 days maybe I just go on a trip for 30 days Daniel doesn't do that Daniel saw this moment different you see Daniel saw this not as opposition but as an opportunity that's the kind of Daring that Daniel is he he wasn't just disciplined he he wasn't just daring he was defiant that's the third one he he he he was def defiant prayer wasn't new to Daniel the Bible reveals that he was so consistent with his prayer that even his opponents knew exactly where to trap him they knew the only way to get him is with his prayer man this this this guy this kid he he prays he was so consistent that if Daniel were here today I could tell you where to find Daniel you'd find him Tuesday morning at the prayer meeting here at Vive church with all the other prayers why would he be here because he prayed he was consistent with prayer he knew the power of prayer and he would pray and so they knew how to trap him they got him at Tuesday morning prayer meeting that's where they got him Daniel showed up even though he knew knew it was illegal to pray and he comes in with what we would often see or even blame as the devil in that moment and say man the devil's coming to get me I'm going to go undercover with my prep I'm still going to pray I'm just going to pray in secret I'm going to pray in private because the devil won't that would be still looking at what the devil brings as opposition God wants us to look at even what the devil brings as an opportunity now now you you're asking now you're asking um okay pastor how was that an opportunity it only looks like opposition well from the surface level it certainly looks like opposition but there previously was no opposition to him praying he could have prayed in his room he could have prayed in the king's court there was nothing outla him praying but the moment it was out Lord for him to pray he had an opportunity to add to prayer sacrifice before this moment he could pray in Surplus but now he had to pray in sacrifice it was going to cost him everything so he saw this as the best opportunity to say oh now my prayers have a cost to it you see in the last several years in the Silicon Valley we've given out of surplus since we started the church the market we've been in it's been it's been amazing it's been great job promotion stock increase there's been so much going on that many of us have had the privilege of giving out a surplus but I know what God wants to do this year is he wants us to give out a sacrifice and you could see that as opposition or you could see it as an opportunity to add some sacrifice to my generosity but Daniel did he said I'm going to do it anyway but now it's going to cost me something not just something it cost him everything honestly he went into his upstairs room he got defiant he opened the window I love that and he didn't just pray but he he prayed more he didn't just pray at breakfast he wanted to make sure that if you were eating breakfast while I was praying get me a lunch I'll be praying then and if you're busy at lunch I'm I'm you'll find me at dinner praying like he three times a day church let me ask do we do we stop doing what God's called us to do because it didn't happen the way we expected do we have hesitate when intimidation comes because somehow it's preventing us from moving forward do we pass do we do we even pause as if God's power is not most evident in opposition do we give up when things don't work out the way that we wanted them to or do we second guess what God said because it doesn't look the way we thought it would no I want to suggest that like Daniel when others are lying when others are cheating when others are stealing we at Vive church are those that are integrous anyway when when the economy is busted and inflation and interest rates R an all-time high and the financial future is uncertain for the society around us I want to tell you a Vive Church we're generous anyway when we're mocked and we have been mocked many times before and criticized for thinking way too big guess what as a church we're going to continue to dream anyway I'm trying to tell you we're going to pray we're going to grow we're going to build we're going to give we're going to help we're going to love we're going to fight we're going to succeed we're going to do it anyway cuz that's what we do at Vive church we have an anyway kind of faith in any way kind of faith in fact regardless of the current state of the economy and whatever happens around the world we are going to awaken people to the reality of Jesus and bring Heaven to Earth anyway with all that in mind allow me to reveal just how this is going to impact the way we outwork the vision for this year you see while inflation is causing some disruption to the economy we are seeing it affect property prices in major cities commercial property in major cities like San Francisco and Oakland and San Jose the cities that we find our churches in are at currently at all-time low with less than 50% occupancy in some of the commercial buildings and while the world is freaking out the church should Rejoice not because we rejoice in people's uh downfall but the opportunity that presents for us to afford affordable buildings so as a church we want to position ourselves to purchase properties we want to purchase properties in several cities located around the world where we find our church I'm talking about downtown prominent locations in cities like San Francisco and cities like Oakland I'm talking about the kind of buildings that right now aren't in the back Lots but are in the in in the most prominent areas buildings that are currently at an all-time low price point that maybe the church has an opportunity to swoop in and secure some Kingdom property there are currently buildings in prominent places that figuratively and soon will literally have Vibes name on it in the name of Jesus I'm making that prophetic in cities like Oakland San Francisco and Beyond and not just buildings but we want to build them out for the next Generation this is why we also want to build into our Royal kids experience something we left off the docket last year because the giving didn't come in and match what the commitment was we couldn't get to the Kingdom of Light it's still pending but we want to keep pushing forward with Kingdom of Light by building a state-of-the-art facilities and all our locations even our locations that are not permanent we want an expression of Kingdom of Light so that we can actually build the church through building families and building the next generation an Academy of young people that know who their God is and understand their calling in Christ Jesus from a young age we're going to build anyway we're also going to continue to Hope anyway last year I had a conversation with the mayor here in Mountain View and I asked the mayor at lunch I said what are the top three needs of the city and he said they're actually the top three needs of every city he said homelessness food distribution and at risk women and L last year because of Hope hanger we were able to solve one of those problems with our food distribution we we were able to affect our local communities and continue as they continue to feel the effect of inflation and job loss hope hanger has been positioned to bring so much needed hope in the form of food clothing and Provisions we've given away thousands of pounds of food in the last year to the local community around us however I also think that we can take a run at those other two areas we're going to do this through a strategic partnership that we're calling hope houses we are I'm so excited I know I'm acting cool but I'm excited because we're currently acquiring a long-term Ministry part partner called New Creation homes which provides a safe refuge for women and a place of a place of of hope that Fosters care and long-term Independence for atrisk mothers in Christ situations this means that we will soon have two homes in East paloalto housing and caring for women and their children while we train them and integrate them back into society not only that we're also taking this opportunity to refresh The Branding of Hope hanger with a new and recognizable icon as we prepared to take hope hanger Global we foresee hope hanger and this icon of the white cone wherever you see the white cone you're going to know that Vive is directing hope you're going to know that the Hope hanger is here and we're going to be directing and distributing hope in my prayer is all across the globe that you're going to see this is going to be an icon of Hope and I can foresee the day that we have hope hangers reaching our communities being the church not just going to church but being the church in every single City that Vive church is in through hope hanger through hope hanger you'll see these cones at our distribution centers you're going to see these cones all across the Earth directing hope wherever Vive church is people going to know they can get food they can get clothing they can get help in the name of Jesus now we're not only committed to building anyway and hoping anyway and we're going to we're going to continue to go anyway see last year we launched out with what we call high impact missions and we sent we sent a missions team to the Dr in a couple of weeks we got a team going to to saelo Brazil and honestly we don't do short-term missions here we do high impact missions because we believe that the teams that go in leave such an impact that it's a lasting impact in that area and we saw such an impact Vibe church that we feel like God is calling us to double down on high impact missions we are adding different regions different teams many more opportunities for you to be a part of and I have to tell you that it is my pastor's heart could you hear this across the globe as the pastor of this church it is my heart that every single person who calls Vive Church home at some point in your life will go on a high pack high impact mission trip that you will take time out of your precious week and your precious time that is precious but you will sacrifice and say God position me to be used put me in a place where my gifts are Force to come out where I have to live beyond myself and I want that because I know what it's going to ignite in your heart when you see God use you in a mighty way not only are we going to be committed to building anyway hoping anyway and going to continue to go anyway but we are going to continue to grow anyway now I need you to lean in because I am particularly excited about this I believe that the future needs a new kind of Minister one that is trained and equipped in Ministry that only comes from exposure and experience developing a new generation of ministers to build his church effectively and with fervency you see I want to train ministers not monks sometimes we think Ministry training comes from a college somewhere or a back room articulating books and theologians I like all that stuff but exposure experience is way more effective on the ministry field and we are positioned as Vibe Church uniquely with all our locations now around the globe and at different growth stages and different cultural settings to expose ministers just imagine with me for a moment you're a senior in high school you don't know what degree you want to get you don't even know what college you want to go to but you do know you want to build God's kingdom and build the house of God and maybe in conjunction with Vive VI while you're getting a degree in Ministry you could go for a few months and be in our London campus or being our Rome campus at different growth stages getting hands-on experience in different cultural settings that you can bring back to your campus in Honolulu or Oakland or Mountain View and go to work building the kingdom or maybe even being position as a future Church planner that we ADV Vive Church aren't limited to just mere funds but we have the power of experience and train leaders to go out and plant churches and Ministries all over the globe I'm I'm talking about a global Ministry apprenticeship the way that electricians get to have an apprenticeship the way that doctors accountants all these people get apprenticeship hands-on experience why can't we have a Ministry apprenticeship that trains high top tier Talent of ministers around the world as if that's not enough we going to keep going for time I want to inform you that while we're going to build anyway and Hope anyway and go anyway and grow anyway we are going to continue to plant anyway that's right we are we are committed to expanding Vive church across planet Earth and last week while we were in Italy we had our vision Sunday in Italy and we announced there first and I'm announcing to you today that in 2024 we will be launching a location known as Vive Moder Moder is an amazing City situated halfway between Milan and Rome and a strategic City near Florence and as excited as I am about this city that's got universities and someone said send me Lord I like that I'm actually excited about our leaders pastors Fabio and Alesia who have been with us since we started in Italy they are so trained and equipped to take this campus on they've been instrumental at every stage of launching Rome and launching Milan and now they've decided that they will take up the Helm of launching our new Moder location however believe it or not I'm not asking you to give to this cuz last week in Italy we had a goal for Italy to raise \u20ac300,000 in the they did it in one single [Music] Sunday Italy is planting a new location in Italy did you hear me right in San Jose Italy is no longer needing funding Italy is now funding a move of God and expanding churches in their Nation I'm I'm just assume that the people sitting and not that you don't know how miraculous that actually is that that a nation who we have funded and started and poured into have now unlocked generosity they're no live longer living from limitation but they've unlocked something and they are freely giving finances to expand the kingdom we've we've just started a ripple effect they're funding it [Applause] themselves what that means since they're doing that we can do something else I've been so excited to to share this with you I've been keeping a secret and I don't like keeping secrets how many people with me like you are the worst of keeping secrets I I will tell everybody don't tell me a secret I'll tell them but I've been a good boy I've been keeping this a secret and I I cannot wait to tell you because in 20124 we are launching a new location in one of the most major cities strategic cities around the world and it is my absolute pre privilege and pleasure to say to you for the first time that in 2024 we'll have a brand new location in Germany called VI [Applause] Frankfurt VI Frankfurt now you may not even know where Frankfurt is and as exciting as having a church in Frankfurt is what's more exciting is the leaders that God has chosen to take on this new Vive Church location in fact let me introduce them to you right now let's play the [Music] video ladies and gentlemen VI Church landed in Frankfurt [Music] Vive church here we are in Frankfurt Germany and I am so excited to be here to bring you into Germany to bring you to Frankfurt but more importantly I'm really excited to introduce you to this amazing couple pastor henck and Pastor Bey now I got to be honest with you straight from the start that when we talk about church planning nowhere did I have Germany or Frankfurt on my heart however the way we've planned in the last 10 years is going to be different from the way we're planning in the next 10 years and less than a location it's more about the people and when you find out about this couple you're going to understand why when God connected us we really s saw the hand of God we saw anointing on their lives and the leadership to take Vive into Frankfurt is exactly what we need through this couple so guys talk to us about I mean you've got so much Heritage History in Ministry already so much connection to this city I don't know where to start maybe just start with your background your ministry background your experience in youth ministry so actually this is a city where I grew up like home for me I went to church in Frankfurt I was a youth leader here then I went to New York to become a missionary and that's where I met my beautiful wife come on now and uh in New York great things happen yeah we dated at C Central Park so it was great so after that 200 we felt the call to go back to Germany and we started to take over a youth ministry leading and pastoring young people but even on top of that we were traveling all over the world preaching the gospel but our heart is not just to be on a stage or on a platform we want to plant something that will change the lives of people we want to see leaders growing we want to see the city changed especially this city is prime yes it's beautiful it needs Jesus it needs Jesus in fact it doesn't need a crowd it needs a church and that's what we've been talking about is building a church here in the city but so let's talk about that for a second I mean you guys have got Ministry experience God's put a desire to plant a church why Vive so we believe in community and the power of community and we came to the amen conference year and we were just amazed of what God did in your church and we said okay Frankfurt needs that as well right and people didn't even know you were there you guys were undercover yes they were amen conference and you didn't even notice that our future Church planners were in the building but God spoke to you guys profoundly he did he did what so many miracles we know that God stands behind it and we're so excited for what comes and we're so excited to learn and and be with you guys it's going to be so amazing you know honestly God has just chosen this couple for us and to extend the Family aive now when I say that Germany and Frankfurt were never on my heart that's my heart I found out that Germany has been secretly on my wife's heart for some time that's babe talk to us where did that come from okay so we took a bit of a trip recently we were TR flying to over to Italy and we had a stop over in Frankfurt yes and that's where I began to tell my husband how much I had a heart for Frankfurt yes and then on that same trip we met these guys and so God has divinely woven this together since I", " was a little girl I prayed for this exact part of the world and I am so happy that God has brought all things full sample for be now planting in this amazing City yes the church I'm so excited I'm so thrilled we've been spend the last couple of days here just planning timing preparation everything and really just building our faith around what God's going to do on frankfor so Church let's dig in let's build again let's give again let's keep stretching and expanding the kingdom as we plant Vive Church in Frankfurt in 2024 let's [Applause] go we're in our London campus last week we're seeing Revival and all across the world we're seeing God move in power I'm so excited for this family to join the family of Vive church and uh and see what God does is we keep expanding and you might you might think oh okay but I don't know anybody in Frankfurt well guess what I'm praying that there is people that you never know on Earth but in heaven they'll be thankful that you opened a door for them that you partnered even when you didn't know their name and it was no benefit directly to you but you opened the door so guys all right we want to talk to you what are you excited about I mean we finally let it out now it feels good doesn't it yeah it's amazing out you guys have been undercover building teams you haven't been waiting even though we've been playing this for a while you've been building teams hok talk to us what are you most excited about and what do you expecting as we kind of really move cuz you guys are about to move to Frankfurt yes yes what are you anticipating next next so we really believe that we will have an amazing church with an open window that is not ashamed of the Gospel you know they say about Germany so many things yes there's so many lies over Germany over Europe the church is dead they say it's just secular it's like just rational people they don't need Jesus but we believe we will see a Revival in Germany come on and we all going to be part of this and we love the global family like we're overwhelmed and so grateful so good I mean you guys are fitting the family so well and uh through Pastor David and M whove been long time friends with you guys it was just an absolute match made in heaven and we just feel the anointing of God on you guys and lyana the baby here and you're pregnant I don't know if that was a secret but we're letting Secrets out today we're letting Secrets out it feels so good to get the secrets out doesn't it Pastor Bey talk to us what are you looking forward to I'm looking forward for Revival and just people on fire fire getting healed getting baptized and just yeah all of it all of it yes set free I mean we we were there these guys are absolutely crazy by the way I'm just going to let you know so we're walking around in in Frankfurt can I tell them the story about the pizza yeah tell tell her I love that and and I'm just enjoying German Pizza I didn't know it was a thing but we're having pizza and and true to to me I ordered way too much and I felt really bad like I'm like oh man we can't waste this pizza and like no let's go and hand it out and we go downtown into the scariest place I've ever been and and here's Pastor henock not just handing out pizza but praying for people and I'm like I knew we're going to see a Revival in Frankfurt through this couple they have a heart for people so people are probably wondering what does it sound like what does Vive sound like in Germany I I took one of your recent sermons that you preached and I thought we could just give them a quick look so check out the screen this is what VI [Music] [Music] this just do what you want Holy [Applause] Spirit if you don't know what he said ask your neighbor hey we got a big Vision ahead of us and this vision is going to take a faith commitment of 4.5 million to achieve all the elements it's above and beyond the tithe $4.5 million that would allow us to achieve the vision it's not a small feat but it's one that can be done by faith and as we gathered on Friday night and the first service across the globe this morning we're currently at $3.9 million committed to the [Music] vision W just $600,000 to go so we're going to have a moment where I'm going to give you the opportunity to respond like like Daniel where you get to open the windows and you can see a giving opportunity as a pressure or a privilege that maybe I don't have all the Surplus I used to have but maybe I can give out a sacrifice so I'm going to hand hand over to other campus pastors right now they can give the response opportunity there and here in Mountain View I want you to take the card out of your seat back pocket and this is what I want you to do is I want you to take this card home with you because on this card we have a gap we do this each and every year we believe that as we put our hand to building God's house we're trusting God's going to build our house and I love talking to people all the time every year about the Miracles that they've seen God do in and through their lives as a result with partner ING with heaven and partnering with God we got stories of people having miraculous children and all kinds of things that that was so difficult but God Made A Way and it's a result of them saying God I'm putting you first I'm seeking you first I'm building your house and so I want you to do that take that home pray about it put it on your fridge a miracle that you need and then I want you to put up the QR code so that we can scan that if you haven't had an opportunity to give yet I want you to scan that code and I believe we're going to close this Gap tonight we have a praise party 5ve at 5 here in Mountain View and I believe that tonight by faith I've organized it already let's do a praise party because we're going to be celebrating I believe the vision fulfilled and committed and so I want you to do this I want you to scan that code and you can digitally fill out what it is that you're going to be committing to this year above and beyond this isn't your tithe this doesn't mean we take our tithe and we redirect it to the vision no we just give our tithe to God but this is an opportunity for us to say God I'm partnering with this plan I'm going to partner with this financially sacrificially what a significant moment this is to say I may not have the Surplus but God let me have the sacrifice an immature Faith only ask God for what he'll do for me a mature Faith ask God for what he can do through me I don't want your faith to be what God can do for you I want you to lift your faith to what God can do through you this year as you stretch and sacrifice and open the windows and say God I'm going to stretch generously toward the vision maybe there's going to be people's lives that will be impacted I'll never know their name of here on Earth but I do believe in heaven I'm going to greet thousands of people that are going to be thankful that I stretch by Faith from m Mountain View California and that we gave significantly to a vision of expanding the kingdom across the [Music] Earth", "hey welcome to the vibe Church podcast I am so glad that you found us I trust that what God brings into your life today through this word is going to

we're consistent in it and uh we believe the Bible holds the words of life we believe the Bible has the answers we believe that the Bible is the Living Word of God it's actively working in your life so as you sit under the teaching of the word of God today get prepared for God to do something in the soil of your heart I just want to prepare you that's not normal just to sit under the word of God and not have an expectation that God's going to speak to you as you simply focus on God's word watch as God will illuminate things about your life and use this like an instrument of change to bring Revelation to speak directly into your situation and I'm particularly excited for what I feel God wants to reveal to us today as he's been stirring faith in my spirit for how he's moving us as a global church and so let's turn to Daniel did I tell you that yet Daniel Book of Daniel uh and I'm going to go ahead and just read from chapter one starting in verse one it says in the third year of the reign of jeim king of Judah Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jeim king of Judah into his hand with some of the vessels note that with some of the vessels of God's house of God and he brought them to the land of shinah to the house of his God and place the vessels in the treasury of his God then the king commanded ashpenaz his chief unic to bring some of the people of Israel both of the royal family and of nobility Youth Without blemish of good opin appearance and skillful in all wisdom endowed with knowledge understanding learning and competent to stand in the king's Palace and to teach them the literature and the language of the Chaldeans the king assigned them a daily portion of the food that the king ate and of the wine that he drank and they were to be educated for three years and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king among these were Daniel Han Michelle Azariah of the tribe of Judah and the chief of the Unix gave them these names Daniel he called Bazar hananiah he called Shadrach meach he called sorry mishel he called meach and Azariah he called Abednego but Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the King's food or with the wine that he drank therefore he asked the chief of the Unix to allow him to not defile himself I want to hold it there I want to pick up this story and preach to you today for week three of our anyway series I want to speak to you from the subject have your way have your way are you sure you're ready for the word of God today all right well convince your neighbor by telling them before you take your seat have your way would you do that real quick go ahead and have your way three people thank you worship team well as Aaron mentioned earlier this week we had the privilege of going to New Orleans did I say it right close enough new New Orleans was one word apparently I thought it was two words silly me and uh we we went to New Orleans my first time in in in the deep deep south of New Orleans and uh it was it was an outof body experience it was an out of this world experience and I know some of y'all are from New Orleans or or Baton Rouge Louisiana you're from some area to you it's normal to me it's it's it's out of this world I won't say weird I'll say it's different it's different I ate food this week that will be with me forever like it's it's it's still stuck we had beet with uh I I feel like we should say we had pwed sugar with beet that's what that's feels like what it was like we had crawfish we had uh alligator and uh we had grits um what was it we had we had fried oysters I I didn't know you could fry them and apparently you can fry any you can fry alligator and you fry it all and we we had it and uh it was it was it was a blast it was a different experience I learned a new language and being in in in New Orleans and and and it was it was amazing not only because of the food but I got to spend some time with some ministers from the south different pastors of some some amazing churches and we got together and we had some great discussions just talking about how God's moving across the nation how God's moving across the world world and we had some great discussion it was fascinating to me to hear their interest about how we do ministry in the Silicon Valley every time I would talk with a a new pastor they they were so fascinated about how it is we do ministry in in in the San Francisco Bay Area because obviously that's evil now now I had to remind them I just did a little tour of the the history of New Orleans and the voodoo I'm like which one's evil they forgot but but it was amazing because they would ask this question what what's it like doing Ministry in the Silicon Valley and and I had to kind of go back to when we started and I was I was reminded that when we first started the church and I would talk to new folks because no one's really from here everyone moves here gets a job and I would meet young bright couples who had just moved to the Bay Area found our church God LED them here and it's always fascinating how you thought you found your way here like you're taking the credit for God's goodness to bring you to such an epic Church trust me you ain't that that smart God is good I thought you get I thought a little amen but we're going to warm up in the latest service today anyway God brought you here and God brought them here and every time I would ask them uh maybe I want to mobilize them help them get involved in the church they would inadvertently always say time and time again hey Pastor that's great but we're not here for long we can't do too much but come again they're like well we got a plan it's like a 2-year plan we're coming in we're going to make some cash and we're going to go back to where we came from so before you get any Grand ideas about plugging Us in and putting us to work we're not here for long so we can't do too much and I had this conversation over and over again and after a while I had to ask are you telling that to me or you telling that to God it sounds like you're talking past me and you're reminding God don't let my heart get connected God I got a plan I got a because that's how we like to pray let's be honest that's how we like to pray God don't mess up my plan you don't say it like that you're not that obnoxious but but but you kind of say God bless my plans God bless my plans God don't mess it up I want to I want to unpack Faith from a different perspective this morning if we could do that because after pastoring for a little while now I've come to the conclusion that more often than not the way we we approach Faith could possibly be the wrong way now I know that's an emphatic statement whoa whoa whoa Pastor you're telling me we could be approaching Faith the wrong way can't you leave some margin for error I want to suggest that that the way as Faith filled Believers that we tend to approach faith our way in other words everything we do is oriented from from our perspective and and how we want things to work out for for for us now I know it could be confusing because even when you're praying by faith how do we actually Pray by faith because we know that we have the power of prayer we know that God is able to do all things therefore we want to bring our requests to God but how do we pray for what we want correctly like especially when we read scriptures like Matthew 7:7 or in in James 4:2 where it says you have not because you've asked not that to me seems like permission to go ahead and ask God for what I want that I have not because I asked not so I better ask God this is what I want can I have it however when you pray that way you actually misappropriate or you actually you kind of cut the the idea of what scripture is saying a little bit too short and you take it in isolation that's always going to be bad for Doctrine by the way if you take a verse out of context and use it in isolation because what James is ultimately saying In this passage is he does say in James 4:2 you don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it however he doesn't stop there he goes on to say and even even when you ask you don't get it because your motives are all wrong what what he's trying to emphasize is there is a bold ask of faith that has to actually work in context you have to have the right motive in other words we can be so guilty of praying shortsighted prayers shortsighted prayers I I don't I don't know if you've ever got what you asked for when you're praying you you're pressing in and you're really praying for something and it's like it's almost like God just gave it to you because he got annoyed I'm not saying God got annoyed but there is a parable that talks about the persistent prayer and and the Widow kept knocking and the King finally said all right have it I wonder if God does that just just to give us a lesson cuz some Seasons we're convinced that this is what we need and we God I want to God I pray God do it God I go all right take it and then you get it and you're like oh actually God I don't want this anymore back out H God can I return policy I don't know what you know what I'm talking about where it feels like I thought I knew best but then what I realized is it wasn't what God had in mind and that's a shortsighted prayer shortsighted prayer is always in the temporary and the immediacy of what I need right now and I'm not suggesting we don't have faith I'm just suggesting that maybe we're missing the power of perspective you see this Vision season it's been interesting to analyze that's what I do I analyze different seasons as a church that what we're going through I hear reports from our campuses around the globe I'm hearing the miracle stories I'm hearing the Breakthrough I'm reading a lot of different stats so I can really kind of get a handle on and analyze what it is that God's doing and setting us up for and and in this season especially in Vision season it serves me with a lot of analytical data on how we're doing as a church Community especially in the context of what God has been doing because in the last 12 months this may have this may be of no concern to you but it's it's super exciting to me that God has uh grown our church dramatically we have seen over 20% growth in our church over the last 12 months and you don't need a courtesy clap I know that doesn't mean neither here nor there maybe it's just harder to get a seat now and then but but regardless it's exciting for me when I see that God has added families into the community that God has added people into the life of the church however there is a disparity to me in my analytics because while the church has grown over the last 12 months in number from this Vision offering to last year we haven't seen a change in the amount of participants we haven't seen a much of a marginal change in the participation in the vision now I'm not a mathematician but I would think if there was more people in the the church we would have greater participation in the vision and I I'm I'm a pastor at heart so I always make excuses like I mean look at the inflation look at the interest rates have you seen the interest rates you know no wonder nobody could participate in in the vision however I wonder if it's maybe maybe when you're new to something you you bring in a in a in a wrong mindset because sometimes we can never have learned something and some we come in with an understanding that we learned in another setting and we misappropriate it in the new setting that God's Got Us in like what I'm convinced of is that most people view finances as precious we we see money is precious that's what we're taught it's what we're taught in the system in the US system the schooling system the work system you are taught to treat money as precious it's what you do all day long long to get money you sacrifice your time for money and so when you spend so much time pursuing money you consider money as precious as my precious this this this this precious thing that you don't have a hold on that actually has a hold on you well what I mean let's think about what's precious what what what's what's what's what's precious is is uh diamonds how how people agree that diamonds are precious okay they're precious and and and that's why fellas your your fiance when you propose is expecting a diamond you can't go to your fiance and say hey I don't believe in this commercial thing how about we get out of the commercial system and we just we just have genuine love she's going to say fool it ain't about the stone being precious but how precious I am and what makes something precious is that it's rare and it's hard to get that's like me I'm rare I'm one of the kind I'm hard to get get me a diamond that's what the conversation needs to to be but that's what determines what's what's what's what's precious is the fact that it's rare and it's hard to get when you treat money as precious that's what your mentality is it's rare and it's hard to get so I better hoard it the kingdom teaches us differently that it's not precious cuz it's rare and hard to get that we have a God who is abundant we have a God who has more than enough it's not like a diamond it's more like sand on the seashore that as I get that and what I can hold in my hands I Can Only Hold so much but as I release it then I have the ability to get more and I get to release it I'm not trying to hold on to sand and stop it from pouring out of my hands and holding it the tighter I hold it the more I lose it no the freely give the freely I receive that's how the kingdom teaches us to Steward finances and what we need to then see is finances not as precious but as my portion to participate in Kingdom activity that that I I wonder if we ever play out our prayers that's what I wonder because I'm sure because you're here in Vive church at some point in time you've prayed a pretty bold prayer I'm pretty convinced you prayed some kind of prayer like God bring Revival to the Bay Area God get my family thanksgiving's coming I'm sure you're going in this week God get Uncle Bob he needs you all right you're like you're like God move in my world God move in my workplace God move in my school you've probably got on your knees at some point in your life and prayed that crazy kind of prayer what do you think happens at the end of that prayer let's play it out are you expecting God to say oh thanks D appreciate you praying that prayer I've been waiting for someone to pray it now I'll go and do it thanks buddy that's not how it works when do praise that prayer God would you move in the Bay Area God says yes now I have a partner do bring your finances that's how it works God says don't pray for what you want to pay for cuz it's like if you you want it let me do it let me get out of the finances because it gets a little prickly when I talk about finances talk so much finances all right cool uh do give your life no let's go back to finances but this is what it's like to understand the way the God wants to work is he's like I'm looking for partnership partnership God is Sovereign he don't need anything he has no needs we cannot provide for his needs because there is no needs with God God doesn't need your worship you need to worship because when you worship you elevate your perspective you get a larger understanding of how big God actually is God doesn't need your worship God is not insecure God is Not not a needy God he's not walking Heaven on men they haven't worshiped me all week I wish Sunday would come no God is not needy he is Sovereign he is over he is large he has resources but what God does in his sovereignty is he limits himself to work in partnership with us what a crazy plan I wouldn't do it but he does he like it's thwart with danger for me you want something done do yourself but God is so good he says you know what we're going to do I'm going to partner with you my whole plan to redeem Humanity my plan to release my good news my grace my gospel that their life can be redeemed and the future can be better than their past I want to do it with your life so let's do this let's take your life let's redeem it so that your new life doesn't look anything like your old life and let your new life be the example of how good my grace is so that when they see you they see me that will be our partnership [Applause] plan so that as partners in advancing his kingdom we get to come in service and we get to come and we get to bring our portion our finances and use it as our participation in the Kingdom God is so good that when you come to Christ now you don't have to leave your career and go to a monastery and take time out and now of a sudden become a minister no God says be a minister in your workplace but take what you do there and bring it into the Kingdom so that it can advance his kingdom on Earth you know one of the one of the things I get a little scared about I'll be honest with you Mo most pastors Love Church growth I get a little scared about it I get a little scared because the danger of growth is that we could become a mega church we've been labeled a mega church and it kind of scares me because we never moved here to start a mega church because a mega church is just a Church where people just come and attend they they come late they leave early they check it off the list as a Christian Duty and I've never came to build a mega church we came to build a mega Army we didn't want a religious Duty that you could just check off we want to create an army of Believers that are mobilized in the Kingdom using their giftings using their talents using their finances using what they've got and being called into the mission of Jesus Christ so I can realize that I'm on Mission with God that's why we do Vision that's why we preach the Bible because the Bible is full of a compelling moment to say how are you going to partner with God what God doing in your life you're not just a spectator in this thing Christianity is not a spectator sport it's participants only it requires a sacrifice and a cost but the privilege is that when you sacrifice there is increase to Your Capacity God expands every time you stretch God expands true you ever been to the gym and lifted weight heavier one time I went to the gym with my brother it's dangerous to go to the gym with your with your brother or your best friend all right just just warning fellas know what I'm talking about because like they lift something you're like I can do that and literally one time we're we're at the gym and me and my brother and we're going for we're like doing all these curls and he's stronger than me soone like and we're getting it that night I couldn't even wash my hair I was like couldn't lift my arms but the next week my my wife couldn't stop touching my biceps she kept grapping I'm like man the stretch produce capacity that's what it does with your finances when you stretch with your finances it's it's a ah it's a stretch but on the other side of it is a larger capacity for God to flow through your life it's the way it it's the way it works and the truth is when we approach what God has for us with the wrong perspective we can easily apply Faith the wrong way I mean let's consider Daniel for a moment we see in Daniel 1 that he was taken into captivity as a teenager as a young man who actually had everything going for him the Bible makes that clear described him as educated as cultured as intelligent as the best looking of all the young men in many ways he was living large in Jerusalem he was living life he had a promising future in Jerusalem until we see the king of Babylon capture Jerusalem and take captive the best young men of Jerusalem to serve in the palace so what we find is we find Daniel as a teenager with a promising future exiled into a foreign land in a in a place where I know you're looking at it ladies you're thinking wow best looking young men that wasn't that wasn't a good thing because the best young men had to serve in the palace and and and and the Bible gives us an indication that he served under the chief unic so if you got Chief Unix you got non- Chief Unix so the best look men became Unix and if you don't know what unic is I'll let you actually do the research in your own time okay and so we got Daniel just picture Daniel had everything going for him now everything's taken from him he's in a foreign land he's forced into serving in a place and his identity's being questioned his culture is being adjusted and here it's where we often see when we in places like this because you might not be in Babylon but you know what it's like to be in a place where you feel like everything's against you I'm sure you know what it's like to be in a Babylon of sorts in a place that you weren't expecting it wasn't part of your plan and it's here where we often try and muster as much Faith as we can to believe that God can get me out God I know you can I know you're able God can get me out because after all isn't God a deliverer like God can surely deliver me from this season this sickness this diagnosis this situ situation this job loss this divorce surely God can get me out of this situation that's how God works right like surely if we were to read on in the story of Daniel we can expect that God is going to deliver Daniel and get him back to Jerusalem and get him back on track right unfortunately when we approach with this idea and this mindset we severely limit God to only working through getting you out if you actually read to the end of Daniel's book you'll find that Daniel never returned to Jerusalem but Daniel did have an anyway Faith he didn't have a my way Faith what do I mean well well Daniel's perspective from the very start was actually unique because the way he presents it in his book is he starts out by saying that God delivered jeim king of Judah into Nebuchadnezzar's hand he doesn't say Nebuchadnezzar took it he said God gave it that's a unique perspective let let me read it says and the lord gave jeim king of Judah into his hand with some of the vessels from the house of God that's a detail I want you to hang on to so so so from the start we see that he actually gave God credit for his situation instead of blaming God for his situation man I could preach for another 40 minutes just on that though we're so often blaming God for our situation instead of giving God credit for the for the opportunity that comes with the situation but I'm out of time so I won't so that but that's that's that's what he did and and the reason that's key is because and the reason Daniel could do that is because Daniel didn't pray like a prisoner are you with me Daniel didn't pray like a p what does it mean to pray like a prisoner well a prisoner is often Behind Bars and the only thing you can pray when you're behind bars is God get me out du get me out I'm stuck I'm in a prison I need your help God get me out that is often the prayer that we pray determining the situation and in some reason in some way I could empathize with your prayer in that moment when you've got a diagnosis that you never planned on when you've got a situation that you couldn't have predicted and it's not what you had planned all along you want to pray God get me out but that unfortunately is a prison of prayer and the truth of the matter is you are not a victim to your circumstance you're not a victim to your circumstance because God is still Seated on the throne and what Daniel did is he didn't pray like a prisoner he didn't pray God get me out what he prayed is God would you step in it's a different orientation to your prayer he didn't waste his time just holding on waiting for the day that he got delivered from Babylon saying I'm not going to do anything until I get delivered no God's going to get me out that's Faith God's going to get me out hey it's been 30 years God's going to get me out it's been 40 years God's going to get me out no no instead of saying God get me out what if we prayed God would you get in would you step into this situation cuz even here I know you can use me it's not that you can just use me in Jerusalem when everything's going fine but even when I'm caught in Babylon God if you would come in here watch what we could do there's a there's a story in chapter five around the vessels and and Daniel interpreting a phenomenon that happened before the king you see after Nebuchadnezzar had died we see the next king is Bazar who remembered that Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem and not only did he take captives he actually took some of the vessels from from the temple and in attempt to impress his friends the king called for the temple vessels uh so they could drink wine together let me in fact let me show you Daniel chapter 5 verse one it says many years later King Bazar gave a great feast for 1,000 of his Nobles and he drank wine with them while Bazar was drinking wine he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver cups that his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem he wanted to drink from them with his Nobles his wives and his concubines so they brought these gold cups taken from the temple the house of God in Jerusalem and the King and his Nobles his wives and his concubines drank from them while they drank from them they praised their Idols made of gold silver bronze iron wood W and stone suddenly they saw the fingers of a human hand riding on the plaster wall of the king's Palace near the lampstand the king himself saw the hand as it wrote and his face turned pale with fright his knees knocked together in fear and his legs gave way beneath him long story short we got the king who's taken the temple vessels he's using them for ungodly practices and all of a sudden we see this handwriting along the wall long story short he he calls in fear all his wise men of the city together to see who could actually interpret what was written on the wall none of them could do it by Daniel Daniel comes in and Daniel reads the letters he interprets it and the king is so impressed the fact that Daniel out of all the wise men could do it he makes him the chief wise men in Babylonian language they were called Magi he was the chief of the Magi fast forward a few hundred years you're going to find some Magi who studied astronomy astrology prophecy dreams they would interpret kinds of things from star signs and different uh artifacts and history and prophetic elements and they'd bring them all together you have these Magi who are wandering through a desert following a unique star they had never seen on any of their star signs before any of their charts had this star been there before but these Magi followed it with the prediction that where that star rested would be the next Messiah these Magi come to a stable where they find Our Savior being born in the manger prophesy saying that this is the king that history talked about the big picture of Daniel's life what If Daniel Prayed God get me out like I got a promising career in Jerusalem God don't you know that's the trajectory of my life I ain't in I ain't trying to be in Babylon I ain't trying to be here I'm trying to be back there where I had everything planned out God you're messing it up get me out but instead he decided to to have the perspective that God you can e even Ed me here and as a as a great reward he was part of the major Narrative of History leading the Magi dare I say responsible for crafting the Magi to look for the King of Kings and the Lord of lords what a what a powerful perspective Daniel Prayed and Daniel could pray that because he didn't have a survival Faith he had a submitted Faith wow great it wasn't God do it my way it was God have your way that's faith in fact this is what Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane right before he went to the Cross he felt the pressure but he said God not my will but your will be done that's a submitted faith and it's verse eight that gives it away verse eight of Daniel chapter one you see because in verse eight it says but Daniel resolved it didn't say Daniel complained it says Daniel resolved what did Daniel resolve in the midst of Babylon being ripped from his homeland being forced into a new way of living he had resolved that even here you can use me we've been talking about in any way Faith Daniel models and anywhere faith and anywhere the god you can use me here oh well that means God can use me in in the marriage I'm in true that God can use me in the career I'm in that God can use me I'm not waiting to get somewhere for God to use me that God I want to you you to use me right here you know in 2017 we had a vision element we've been doing Vision every year since we started the church but in 2017 we had a unique Vision element that we launched for those of you that were here you would remember this we we had a vision element called Church online we're going going to stream our services now I know because you've all lived through the pandemic that doing anything online is not new but back then it was back then it was Forefront it was Silicon Valley at its finest and we were streaming Church online and we had no idea why we're just being obedient to God I love that's the way God works sometimes you're asking God to show you what he wants to do in your life before you say yes that's not how God works God's looking for for a yes then he shows you what you're going to do God's looking for obedience first he's not going to negotiate with you where you say hey God what do you want me to do he tells you go H I don't know don't work like that God's looking you God's looking you already have my yes that's what God wants so we just yes we didn't know who was going to reach or what it was going to do but after a year we we started to see some patterns in the people that were constantly on each and every Sunday and we got really excited right Pastor en Isel is the online campus is when we when we realized this this this amazing lady called Goram by the name of Goram from Istanbul Turkey we thought this is wild we've got this amazing woman who started out just by searching accidentally it came across her feed and she started to watch a service and got really intrigued started to watch another service and started to listen to the message listen to the word of God and sure enough over time she had her life transformed she gave her life to Christ on our online campus pastors Ena lelle letter her to Jesus Christ not only that she became part of our online team and would lead people to Christ and pray for people to come to Christ and minister to people and welcome people to church from Istanbul Turkey in the midst of an Islamic Nation Muslim Nation where it is anti it is illegal to be a Christ follower they came with consequences she was rejected from her family kicked out of home attacked abused and most recently her dad tried to kill her she's been an out of Hospital actually been surgery in out of surgery been a hospital we've been praying for every Tuesday morning as a prayer team as a pastoral team we've been praying for every single day and it's been an up and down Journey I've got to tell you I'm so thankful for goram's friends she's got these friends that are incredible I I already love them they're going to make great Believers one day in the name of Jesus but they keep reiterating to us because because in that Nation her family's rejected her but her friends are sticking by her even though in each message they send us they make sure we know we're not Christians we're not Christians but your God keeps coming through cuz she's had surgeries she'd come out and then she'd get an infection go in and the doctors that many times have actually given up hope and they've said he prepared to say goodbye but good old Goram keeps coming through good old gam keeps coming through Jesus won't let Goram go cuz he's got a plan for her here on Earth and her friends are texting us even could you give us a prayer to your God that we can pray over her and it's moving my heart as I'm watching the testimony of goram's Life impacting the people around her one of the latest corresponden we got is the sharing that her vitals have all improved and the doctors want to bring her out of being unconscious to to to bring her into Consciousness but her friends are freaked out we're texting back why that's what we want and like no no you don't understand we know gwam well like we know gwam too we want to talk to her we want to communicate to her like no no we know gaam she she's in here because she talked about Jesus and we know the moment she wakes up she's going to talk about Jesus so we're nervous about her waking up because we know that a doctor or a nurse or someone walks into the room she can't help herself she's going to talk about Jesus church I'm telling you gcam doesn't just have an anyway Faith she hasn't anywhere faith that even in her hospital room even under surgery even in that setting where she can barely Master enough to say how she feels she's talking about Jesus under heavy persecution under under threat of death She's like God can use me here even in my Babylon God can use me here she isn't saying God get me out of here get me out of turkey get me out of Istanbul will get me out of this place this place is hostile to the kingdom this place is no no she's like even here as my wife preached last week if I die I die but I will proclaim the name of Jesus Christ even here even here God

baptized the there's three categories anyone who hadn't been baptized yet anyone who was baptized as a child before you made the decision for yourself or anyone who has maybe had a season where you felt like you've wandered away from God and you've come back and you're making that declaration I'm back baby I'm back and I'm all in they're the people that need to get baptized today so as you prepare your hearts I want to read from a passage of scripture to set the atmosphere I want to read from Acts chapter 8 I'm going to let you sit down in a minute but maybe we could just stand for the reading of God's word acts chap 8 verse 26 this is going to set the tone the atmosphere for what I want to teach today around baptism it says now an angel of the Lord said to Phillip rise and go toward the South to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza this is a desert place and he rose and went there was an Ethiopian a un a court official of Candace Queen of the Ethiopians who was in charge of all her treasure he had come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning seated in his Chariot and he was reading the prophet Isaiah and the spirit said to Phillip go over and joined the Chariot so Philip ran I love his obedience his obedience wasn't a walk his obedience wasn't delayed his obedience was a run so philli ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked do you understand what you are reading and he said how can I unless someone guides me and he invited Phillip to come up and sit with him now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before it sheer is silence so he opens not his mouth in his humiliation Justice was denied him who can describe uh this generation for his life is taken away from the earth and the unic said to Phillip about whom I ask you does this Prophet say this is is it about himself or about someone else then Philip opened his mouth and beginning with the scripture he told him the good news about Jesus and as they were going along the road they came to some water and the unic said see here is water what prevents me from being baptized he commanded the Chariot to stop and they both went down into the water Philip and the unic and he baptized him when they come up out of the water the spirit of the Lord carried philli away and the Unix saw him no more and went on his way rejoicing wow what a story I want to quickly come back to one statement by the Ethiopian unic it it's in verse 36 it says here is water what prevents me from being baptized I I want to turn his statement into a question for you today here is water what's preventing you from being baptized today you ready to go on a journey together all right I want you to do something is prepare your heart for the word of God I want you to find four or five people around you embrace them highfive them give them some kind of love show them that you love them and encourage them ask them have you been baptized yet do it real quick do it do it do it do it so I was telling the the ladies this weekend at Vibe girl conference that I had to take my ring off that the first time in my wedding ring first time in 22 years I have taken this wedding ring off my finger and uh to be honest with you it's been probably the last decade that I've been anticipating this day because my my hand has been growing over my finger you got to remember I was young I was 21 when Kira took me off the market and uh and so I I was I was a few kilograms lighter back then and uh and you know despite my best efforts of running and dieting I haven't been able to retract my finger size to the point I was when we got married and so because it was cutting off the circulation and I didn't want my finger to fall off I thought it I'm facing the facts as emotional as it is I'm taking my wooden ring off honey and uh it's the first time in 22 years that I've taken this ring off but this is not the first wedding ring I've had nothing scandalous just saying Vox Jen with the Judgment save your judgment for when you're married all right it's another the first ring because my first ring only lasted two weeks two weeks you see when we got married I was so pumped about getting married but there was a delay on the order of the wedding ring it came right before the day we got married and and when it came it was way too big I'd put on my finger and as if I just move my hand it would fly across the room but but I didn't want to I didn't want to get married without a ring so my plan was Let's Get Married let's use this ring and when we get back off our honeymoon we'll just go and resize this thing no problem no big deal so we did it we got married went on honeymoon and I I was so careful because I didn't want to swim in the in the honeymoon pool without a ring on you know what I'm saying so I I made sure I swam clothes fist you know what I mean cuz I was keeping the ring on my finger I went everywhere I like I almost taped my fingers together just to make sure people could see cuz I wanted everyone to know I'm married to her and and and we got back from the honeymoon and I was excited because I was greeted with a phone call from my buddy a good buddy of mine I grew up in who had recently given his life to Christ he had the Revelation he's going to get baptized he's like let's I want to get baptized and so me and my other buddy we said let's let's do it where we were living a brand new place we were living in there was this river behind us and we're like let's let's do it there and so he came over we went down to the river we baptized my friend it was an awesome opportunity and it was amazing experience and we were so excited afterwards that we said let's celebrate let's jump off the bridge normal normal male Behavior normal male mindset right there I know the L's like why would you do that because he just came to life in Christ Let's test it and so we we did we went up to the bridge just stood out there together as brothers and we just launched off this bridge and free fell into the river and the moment I hit the water I felt the ring I just scrambling I was scrambling in the water I'm trying to but it was it was it was a current that was flowing and it was murky and and it was kind of deep so you'd swim down to the bottom and trying to feel like this thick mud the sludge trying to just get grapple at something that felt like a ring I'm coming up I'm taking breath they're wondering what I'm doing I didn't have time to explain because you know your position where you lost the ring and so I'm trying to keep that proximity in mind I end up coming up I recruit them to help me we're all diving down we're all almost drowning I this is not working I got an idea let's go get my my flippers so we went cuz you know I needed to fight the current I was I was running out of energy so we got the flippers and my buddy's like well you have one and I have one and and it's twice as many people doing half as much work as what we thought that didn't work either so I thought you know what I need to do I I need a breathing apparatus so so we got my brand new garden hose I hadn't even used it yet all right because we just moved in the house we just married and so I got this brand new garden hose and my my thought was an extended snorkel and so I'm I'm literally going down the plan was you hold it above the water you have the flippers and hold it above the water and I'll I'll get down the bottom and I'll just breathe and I could stay down there until I find the ring well well it was a 10 probably about a 10t garden hose but it was 11t deep because when I got down to the bottom all of a sudden I was sucking water in from the bottom I I came to the top I'm like bro what what happened he goes you just went too deep I was fed up I was exhausted I was almost drowning I said hold the hose I'm going to go down one more time I went down and guess what I didn't find it I came up coughing and I was like where's the hose he's like oh I I thought you had the you lost my hose brand new single income we swam to the shore I said bro where's where's the flipper he said oh it was Hur my foot it's a bit small you lost my I lost my wedding ring I lost my garden hose and I lost my flipper I literally looked him in the eyes and I said bro it didn't just cost Jesus for your baptism it cost me too just be honest with just so you know just that's meant to be funny let me get to the word of God I want to take this to Mark that's where I would like to start our explanation of baptism my goal is to maybe educate you on what baptism really is today I find that most most often we know about baptism just from an experiential point of view maybe even those that have been baptized today but you may not thoroughly know the origin of what baptism is meant to represent even though you've been baptized and if you have not been baptized I want to encourage you again that at any point during my sermon today you feel the urgency of the holy spirit that today is the day you cannot delay or be disobedient any longer there are people waiting for you to equip you so we can do this and we're going to do this in parts today we're going to baptize people we're going to keep keep on teaching but I want to make sure we cover some areas and I want to start by asking why be baptized a good place to start would be Mark now all four gospels actually record a different element of Jesus baptism for significant reasons but I want to start Us in mark because Mark's not only concise Mark begins with baptism as if baptism the baptism of Jesus was kind of like an like an activation of sorts or somewhat see in Mark 1:4 it says John appeared it's John the Baptist baptizing people in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance and forgiveness of sins and all the country of Judea and Jerusalem were going out to him he's a popular guy and were being baptized by him in the River Jordan confessing their sins now John was clothed in Camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey and he preached saying after me comes he who is mightier than I the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie I've have baptized you with water but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan and when he came up out of the water check this out immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove and a voice Came From Heaven you are my beloved Son done with you I am well pleased now this moment right here is one of the most theologically rich moments we have in all of scripture but before we unpack the significance of this profound moment I kind of want to zoom out and give us some context to understand what what the setting actually is you see Jesus's moment had come this was his moment to begin the ministry that would preedee him going to the cross now the ministry last the ministry of Jesus lasted 3 years from this moment to when Jesus went to the cross and was crucified was about a three-year period of Ministry for Jesus where Jesus ministered in that Ministry period that Ministry period served a particular uh set of uh servings to set up the kingdom to recruit disciples to reveal God's power to activate God's Redemption plan to establish the church and to fulfill ancient prophecy confirming Jesus's own statement that he was indeed the Son of God now beginning with baptism was a significant move it was a smart move by Jesus to begin with baptism because some 400 plus years earlier to this moment the prophet Isaiah had prophesied about this moment had prophesied about John the Baptist believe it or not that John this voice would be crying out in the wilderness preparing the way for the coming Lord and that was what John was doing he was out there preparing he was out there making noise making uh making people baptized profess their sins baptizing them in Repentance he was preaching about repentance and he was baptizing for the Forgiveness of sins this is what baptism is essentially at the core if you don't know what baptism is baptism is an outward declaration a of an inward decision because your conversion to Christ is a spiritual transaction while very much evidential and very much tangible because it happens in the heart it's very much invisible to us the change in you is visible I hope but the transaction moment of conversion to Christ is invisible to everybody around which is why baptism becomes the public moment where others get to witness my decision so why did why did John preached the message of repentance specifically well you need to know that repentance is not an apology I I need you to get your mind around this CU sometimes we we we see repentance as an apology that you want your kids to repent oh I'm sorry Mom that's not repentance that's an apology repentance is a change of action repentance isn't even done with words it's done with deed repentance isn't just something I say it's something I do it's it's an action or better still a change of action and the Bible actually reveals repentance is exactly that it's a change of action in Acts chapter 3: 19 it says repent therefore and turn back that your sins may be blotted out we even find the Apostle Paul he summarizes his entire ministry as a Ministry of repentance in Acts 26:20 saying this he he says first to those in Damascus and those who in Jerusalem and in Judea and then to the Gentiles I preached that they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds not demonstrate your repentance by your words but demonstrate your repentance by your Deeds I need you to understand that when when John's preaching repentance he's saying turn from your ways how do you turn from your ways you don't just say okay you do something different from the way you were doing it before it's repentance it's repentance it's a change of action change of ways so what we have here we also see that repentance would be best defined as a change of mind that results in a change of action that upon the Revelation that I I've been sinning on the Revelation that I haven't been living the way that God's called me to live on on on the Revelation that that you change your mind which always results in a change of action it would be hypocritical to have a change of mind but do the same action it's for this reason that we see John was preaching repentance and he was accompanying it with baptism as an act of action for repentance it was an immediate action that people that were coming and they were confessing their sins they had the Revelation that the the way they were living wasn't the way that God had called them to live and so they came in Repentance and what baptism did is it provided with an immediate action that on the Revelation I'm going to put some action upon the Revelation that I'm coming in Repentance let the first action I take be baptism so then this understanding raises the question why would Jesus who had no sin had to didn't have to repent from anything get baptized well John's gospel actually gives us a different facet and a deeper Insight by actually adding another element to this moment because John reveals the moment that John the Baptist saw Jesus I want to show you real quick John chap 1: 26 we're going to get to baptisms in just a moment but it says this John answered them I baptized with water but among you stands one you do not know even he who comes after me the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie these things took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptized in check this out verse 29 the next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me comes a man who ranks before me because he was before me John had this moment Jesus was Jesus was among the crowd can you just imagine that for a moment John's baptizing folk and they're out he confessing this their sins and he's like there's one among you that you don't even recognize but all of a sudden this one day as John sees Jesus coming he exposes him to everyone the Lamb of God Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world the crowd must have looked and said who is he talking about this man this is the Lamb of God and Jesus walks into the water and he himself gets baptized by John you see Jesus wasn't however getting baptized for repentance he was getting baptized by way of recognition he was being recognized as the one that John had been preparing the way for to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah Isaiah had laid it out pretty plainly that there is one coming that I'm making a way for this is him this is the one so Jesus was going into the water he was making a statement he he was baptized and we see something profound by Jesus right before he ascended after he res he was raised from the the grave he gave this command to us to be baptized it's in Matthew 28:19 it's known as the Great Commission he says go therefore Make Disciples of all Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and of the holy spirit so I thought we could do something there's many reason why we should get baptized but first and foremost it should come as obedience to Jesus because Mark mentions that as Jesus came up out of the water he witnessed something incredible says in verse 10 and when he came up out of the water immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove and a voice Came From Heaven saying you are my beloved Son with you I am well pleased now this is one of the most EMP fatic Triune moments we'll get to witness in scripture where you have the Son of God beginning his ministry you have the spirit of God coming upon him and confirming his ministry and then you have the father also by a verbal voice from Heaven authorizing his ministry I mean what a way to begin if you're going to begin a Ministry season this is the way to start to start with the Holy Spirit coming upon you and an audible voice from Heaven That Shook the head Heavens with an open Heaven saying this is the one this is the one see that's what the baptism moment signified for Jesus it was that I'm here and I'm ready to go I'm beginning I'm starting and I mean we know that the Bible says to be baptized we know that baptism is important but let me ask the next question why water what's what's the deal with going into the water and why is the water significant well in part we see all the way back in the Old Testament with the During the levitical period that water was a significant part of the ceremonial cleansing process that the high priest would have to go through in order to go into the holy of holies however while water was done in one sense used as a representation of washing away of sin it's also connected us with the death burial and resurrection of Jesus see Colossians chap 2:12 says having being buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God who raised him from the dead Romans 6 also says something similar verse three saying do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death we were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father we too might walk in newness of life so when I go down under the water the way that Jesus went into the grave I'm being baptized into his death so that I can be also baptized into his resurrection the same way Christ was not contained to the grave but came up out of the Grave so my baptism is a connection to the death burial and resurrection of Christ I I've been connected to his death the way that by going into the grave he took the we of my sin as I go into the water I acknowledge that my sin is no longer my sin it's been washed from My Life by the Redemptive power of Jesus and what he run through the grave as Galatians 2:20 says I have been crucified with Christ it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me you can just go ahead and clap right there at that moment that scripture deserves an Applause every single [Applause] time and we see here that water becomes significant it's not the only reason for for water you see when Jesus was baptized when John was baptized he he was he was on his way to the Cross he hadn't gone to the Cross so baptism does connect us with the death burial and resurrection of Jesus but when John was baptizing no one had died yet so there's another meaning and significance around the water especially in going all the way under because going all the way in is the Christian statement of baptism you see Christian baptism isn't a sprinkling of water Christian baptism isn't a splashing of water Christian baptism is marked by full immersion in water and the full immersion is significant because it was the statement that Jesus was making when he got baptized by John it was at the beginning it was the starting gun it was the activation moment of ministry and so when Jesus went into the water he wasn't repenting of sin he had no sin he wasn't confessing sin he had nothing of sinful to confess what he was saying was a statement that I'm going all the way in this isn't all the way to the Cross moment that from this moment forward he wasn't just dipping his toe in and wondering well if the people receive my message if I don't offend too many people then maybe I'll I'll bear with it no from that moment on regardless of how he was treated regardless of whether the people accepted his message or not whether they got it or not he's like I wasn't just dipping my toe in I'm going all the way in I am fully immersed in this plan of God and I'm taking it all the way to the cross it was 3 years from that moment to the Cross but it might as well been the very next say that's how all in he was that's how all in he was he was going public he was he was bold about it I'm going public fully immersed as Galatians 3:26 says so in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ what's the Apostle trying to say that when you were baptized with Christ you were fully immersed into Christ that the way we do full immersion you watch out guys they won't leave one pit dry because we ain't going to leave one bit of your life separate from Christ God doesn't just save one part of your life he saves your whole life in the fullness of Christ that every area of your life is now immersed in the resurrection power of God [Music]", "hey Welcome to our brand new series called seed stage this is our finance Series where we're taking it all the way back to seed stage really focusing on how the finance that we have is seed that God can use as we begin to sew it we're going to begin to see blessing in our world and I know you're going to be blessed as a result of this sermon so dig in and enjoy we are in week two of our brand new series called seed stage let me remind you this is not a finance series it's a freedom series we're getting free in the area of our finances and if we unlock this area it's amazing what God can do in and through our life but let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 9:1 says he being God who supplies seed to the S and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sewing and increase the Harvest of your righteousness you will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way which through us will produce Thanksgiving to God verse 12 for the Ministry everyone say Ministry of the service is not only supplying the needs of the Saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God in week one of the series we identified that we have all been well supplied and we differentiated between what is seed and what is feed today I want to dig in a little bit press in on this a little more and I want to speak to you today from the subject provided with potential Prov provided with potential you all ready for the word of God all right find five of your favorite people in your immediate vicinity and give them some kind of love would you show them some kind of love show them show them a fist bump a handshake a high five whatever is appropriate to the level of your relationship go ahead and have an interaction of some sort amen so I have been uh training our girls you know this I've mentioned this training our daughters two of our doors our twins how to drive it's been back to driving instructor training season and I've been successful they getting their licenses but the whole process of driver training is fascinating because these days and for those those dads that don't yet have kids that are driving and you've yet to go this process something that I might make you aware of is it's not just teaching them how to steer a vehicle turn a vehicle on and use the elements of the vehicle you you actually have to teach them how to navigate as as well this is like this is this is another tool that we often forget about because it's so automatic having a GPS and so we've been training them how to program the navigation system and how to follow the navigation system not just because that ain't always going to be there to say turn right now stop you know what I mean like there's going to have to be some instructions and and we were talking about the other day is we're programming it in I said you don't even know how easy you got it cuz cuz the GPS hasn't always been around and they're like what do you mean I'm like back in the day we had to have a book of maps and that you had to like pre-plan your route and I as an electrician I was telling them I had to pre-plan the night before all the different places I had to go to the different jobs the sites I had to plan out the freeways the highways the side streets the back streets the the counter plans and then because if you had like an old map and streets were updated there was no map at all you had to like phone the customer and just get the directions and handri you had to have a plan now you don't have to be planned at all you just punch it in gives you the fastest route gives you the shortcut but back in the day we had to have a plan and you had to learn how to Pivot on the plan you know if the customer wasn't home where you going to go now and how you going to get there in fact I was telling them a story it just went from that to a story about when I was an electrician and we had we had plans we had to follow plans uh when we're doing installations and I had a had a bus I was an apprentice we had another Apprentice who was a little bit younger earlier stage Apprentice than me and my boss would do illegal things where he would just he would go and take us because this was it's illegal you can't just leave an apprentice unsupervised on a job site but he made extra money if he was at another job and he put us at a job and and so he would take us there and he gave us the plans he said just follow the plan you'll be fine and so we'd be at this job site and we'd look at the plans and we'd go to work and we're at this one Mega Place one time and we had to put in like some hundreds of these downlights in in this building according to the plan and so I looked at the plan and the other Apprentice he was looking at the plan and I'm reading the plan he's across from me reading the plan and I said I'm going to take this section he's like okay and he's like you I said you take that section he's like okay so we go to work for a few hours we go to work according to the plan well when I came to look at his work it wasn't according to the plan he had put about 50 down lights in the wrong place and I was like bro what happened to the plan and he's like I I was looking at the plan I said come and show me on the plan where that resembles that and he came around to my side of the plan and he's like oh I see from this side he was looking at the right plan but the wrong way you thought that was bad you should have seen how our boss reacted we got fired literally both of us got fire that day and uh he said to me so what's the plan I said I don't know about you but I'm starting my own business bro see you later you have to have a plan plan how many people know you have to have a plan you got to have a plan in life in fact there there is this might be I don't know if this has be CH maybe I could ask this how many people are planned you would say you're a planned person you're a planner in life please please raise your hand please be involved in the church service today okay how many people say you're more spontaneous you kind of like to just go with it isn't it funny how marriages are divided right now honestly both have their advantages and their disadvantages you see the the planner always creates a sense of security and structure around them because they're providing a clear pathway for for people to align with and walk on however the on the other hand the spontaneous person who who likes to stay more fluid in life when when plants change or when things don't go to plan they they actually have the ability to Pivot with ease and create a new pathway quite frictionless now now the truth is planning is not only an important part of life believe it or not it is a deeply spiritual practice because it requires both discipline and the consideration of others as they taught me in seminary when you fail to plan you plan to fail now now what what actually might be comforting Revelation for you today especially for those that actually struggle with uncertainty around the future and what God has for you I want you to know this and maybe this is going to be helpful to write down God has a plan it's simple but it's going to be profound for you to know that God has a plan in all your plans or lack of plans regardless of how planned or unplanned you are I want to let you know from the pulpit that God has a plan in fact the truth is he's had a plan from the very beginning and not only has he had a plan but that plan is still in Play Because unlike our plans God's plans don't change we see this in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and when it comes to God's plans scripture makes it real plain let me show you this as as we see in Isaiah chter 46:9 it says remember the things I have done in the past for I alone am God I am God and there is none like me only I can tell the future before it even happens everything plan will come to pass for I do whatever I wish that's that's God that his plans will come to pass he does whatever he wants in fact go not only does God have a plan but he has plans he he got plans for Nations he got plans for for people groups he got plans for churches he's got plans for IND individuals he's got a plan for this church actually the church is God's plan can I just put it real playe it was God's idea it it was what Jesus came to establish from Ministry we see that he came to establish and found the church and he has caused us to continue what it is that he began and all of this is very important to know so that we firmly understand that God's plan is not reactionary it's preemptive God God's plans aren't pivoted God's not pivoting on the plans because you did something unpredictable that God wasn't expecting no no no God's plan is prescriptive and preemptive cuz God's in control you see God has plans on plans with the overarching plan being that every human would actually come to know him and accept his salvation that that's the plan that that we would fellowship with God that's part of his plan that we would not only know and discover the good works that he has for us but but we would also experience the expans of his love for us it's what the Apostle Paul says and he lays out in Ephesians chap 2:10 he says for where are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them in fact can I just go a little philosophical on you this morning I'm trying to preach some truth to get us warmed up but I do want to kind of tap into the philosophical element of our thinking and make sure we process God's plans well because part of God's plan is that we would actually discover his plan God's got a plan that you'd learn his plan he's got a plan for you let me give you a classic scripture Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord that God has a plan for you in fact actually let me let me read it properly for you because it doesn't just tell us that God has a plan it also reveals what his plan is concerning us it says says for I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future how many how many people would agree that this is a good plan this is an inspiring plan but I wonder what's God's plan to fulfill that plan and and and how can I be certain that what I'm doing right now is fulfilling God's plan what I'm doing in life on a dayto day am I actually contributing to fulfilling God's God's plan well as we discovered last week with the seed bag and from our series scripture God actually provides us with everything we need to fulfill his plan can I quickly remind us what the scripture says it says in verse 10 of 2 Corinthians he who supplies seed to the S and bread for food that Seed and Feed will supply and multiply mly you see that word there multiply your seed for sewing and increase the Harvest of your righteousness now if you haven't notic this about a characteristic of Jesus is that that that that he is into multiplication like he's really into it it's like one of his favorite things to do Jesus loves to multiply we we see it last week with the Loaves and the fish uh you'll actually find also that at the wedding of Kaa Jesus multiplied the amount of wine uh also with Peter he multiplied his catch it's kind of a thing that Jesus does it's like one of his characteristics you see multiplication like oh that Jesus has been here it's like there's more than there was before Jesus has been here it's like a trademark of Jesus it's like a characteristic of Jesus Jesus loves to multiply he loves to take what we see as limited it says watch when I put my power upon it it multiplies it doesn't divide divide it multiplies that's important for you to know God doesn't divide he multiplies cuz if you just simply took something and divid it you would have lesser versions of that same thing but he doesn't divide he multiplies that thing he makes more of that thing it's important to know about the way God works and not only that the Bible reveals that good management is measured in your ability to multiply what you've been given did you catch that that the measure of good management is in your ability to multiply what you've been given I think the front row caught it but I don't know if it made it be on the front row is this on yeah you the Bible makes it very clear that if you are to be a good manager to manage what you've been given is not measured in keeping what you've been given but multiplying what you've been given to to literally have the characteristic and the nature of Jesus operating with because remember Jesus is in the multiplication so so so be like Jesus be like Christ and begin to multiply what you've been given that's the measure of good management that's what we see with the parable of the talents when the servants came back just with what they were given I buried it looked after it I protected it guess what I know in Earthly settings if we came back with what we were given we didn't lose it especially in this economy especially in this stock market especially in the in the nature of what God's got going on man in the world man if I just bring back what I've given I didn't lose any of it you didn't lose you didn't gain but you didn't lose then we would say Hey you managed that well but in the kingdom of God that's not considered good management that person is considered a wicked and lazy servant good Management in the kingdom comes with multiplication but what I was given I put it to work and I bring bring back an increase an increase inrease I increased what was what was given this is because God not only gives you what you need for today he also provides you with seed for what's coming I'd understand if your management was based on just existing if God's plan for you was just to survive then scripture would reiterate that God gives you enough for today that that's why we couldn't exist on Mana it was enough for the day couldn't store it couldn't hoard it couldn't hold it couldn't keep it couldn't trade it that that was for then but under the New Covenant God doesn't just give us enough for today he gives us seed for tomorrow that if we would actually be part of God's plan not just recipients of God's plan but as part of God's plan we would actually put the seed to work actually a really good way to discover what God God's got planned for you is actually to assess what he's already given you if you if you ever want to know what it is that God's got planned for you I don't know if you've ever asked that question I don't know if you've ever like kind of considered that like what has God called me to do in life and what's what's what's God go for me what's his plan for my life specifically a good place to start is to look at what you got it's the way God works he kind of God's mysterious he he likes to he likes to be sought he has promises that if you seek you'll find if you knock the door will be opened God just likes to do this because he likes to be pursued he he likes an engagement he's got Mysteries not so that we would never find him but just so that we would seek him because God works in Revelation that when you seek you actually find and you get the Revelation this is what God's called me to do so what God does he'll give you things that you don't even know you've got until you begin to look when you begin to assess what you've got you begin to get a realization or Revelation that maybe this is part of God's plan is to use the things that he's given me to do that's that's what second Corinthians reveals reveals that God gives us seed another way to say it is he provides you with potential so to get an indication of what the potential is on my life and what God wants to do in and through me I should assess the seed that he's already given for example God gives us spiritual gifts and when it comes to the gifts from God they always come in seed form if you're trying to look in your life for a fully developed gift look again it'd be nice wouldn't it if God gave us a fully-fledged gift like it's already in operation like it's a magnificent gift like the first moment we use that spiritual gift like maybe it's a gift of Prophecy and we're just like man we're just reading mail we're just unpacking people's history future things that nobody knows about them and that nobody dares know but they know and then you say it and then the power of God comes over them they get transformed right in that that moment like you've never given a prophetic word before but it's like bam or or maybe it's a healing gift where you've never ever stepped out in healing but you just decide today's the day you lay hands on someone and they get out of a wheelchair or they get out of the hospital or something massive happens it don't work like that because the gift comes in seed form it comes with a idea maybe I should encourage somebody but as you begin to step out speak encouragement or exaltation what you begin to realize is that God grows that seed and produces fruit and it becomes a fully developed gift but it always starts in seed form God gives it in seed form in fact that's what seed does is seed represents potential not only does a Single Seed actually hold unlimited potential it also remains as potential while it remains a seed what I mean is seed has an incredible ability to remain dormant even for decades but still retain the power of potential I I I came across an article that uh the article was called prehistoric seed and it caught my attention uh because I like oh okay this is this is interesting uh and and it was talking about the fact that in Mada they they had uncovered buried clay pots that had seed still in it that had been preserved for centuries and they took took this seed and they planted this seed and It produced these kind of ancient date palms that they thought were extinct that they thought weren't any around anymore and as they planted this centuries old seed it's it actually produced date palms and that's crazy because it was centuries years old that it had lasted dormant for Centuries with all the potential the potential to produce dates the potential to produce fruit but but while it was still in the seed stage it was dormant it's not until it's sewn in the soil that it produces the potential and you might look at the seed and go well that's some cool seed you know what's way cooler than seed is the fruit is the plant is what it produces but so much of us are just still sitting in the seed stage and not in the produce stage sitting dormant on what God's given us but hoarding it and holding it not releasing it so they can actually produce what the potential is intended to produce you see a fun fact and I'll give you a fun fact because I've been dabbling in the Venture Capital world and I know a little thing or two now and what you me might need to know if you're a Founder if you're starting is that the seed round funding is pretty exciting because your whole seed round funding is actually raised on potential just the potential of something it's it's crazy you don't even have to have a product haven't have to proven anything just a potential you can raise money on a potential you can get funded off potential it's a crazy world we live in but just the potential later stage funding you have to have performance but at the beginning you have to have potential because potential speaks about what's to come and potential is exciting but there has to be a point where potential becomes performance where where the potential has to become realistic where has to be realized it can't stay potential forever because while a seed can stay dormant it won't produce the fruit that it's intended while it stays at a seed stage now allow me to help Define some things when it comes to God's plans because they they're most often outworked through God's promises a not just God's promises there's two avenues that God works through he works through his promises and biblical principles I want to unpack this for you because this is going to be helpful to understand how do I take it from seed or potential to fruit in my life and to know the difference is important because they're most often mixed up you see the promises of God are God's guarantee where principles actually hold all the potential let me explain it because you'll see with the promises and the principles there're they're going to find that they actually both established by God however there is a difference God's promises are unfailing and completed by his own divine nature for instance take Abraham he's a great example of God's promises he had the promise that he would become the father of many nations yet he didn't even have a son he himself was old and his wife's womb was Barren but but none of these elements or hurdles or obstacles could prevent God's promises from coming to pass not even a dead womb if God speaks it it will come to pass if God promises it not even something that's dead can prevent God's promise cuz God will just raise it so that's how the promises of God he is faithful to his promise principles are similar however principles require our participation they actually require something from us however before I tell you what they require I I thought maybe I could tell you what a principle is I'm not going to assume we all know what the principles of God are but but but maybe because last week I gave you six pillars for financial success I I could maybe give you six principles that you could live by today just for all the note takers here for all the planners in the room give you six biblical principles the first one I want to give you is live above and beyond would you write that down live above and beyond Matthew 5:41 says says if anyone forces you to go one mile go with them two miles that's Jesus this is also known as having a second mile mentality and will position you to always provide more value than what's required that's what Jesus was he said he's a principle for Life go above and beyond if someone's expecting the bare minimum go further don't don't don't just operate in the world like a bare minimum mentality go Second Mile mentality if someone's asking you to deliver on a project deliver early deliver better than a expected provide more value number two principle is keep the Golden Rule Luke 6:31 says do to others as you would have them do to you Jesus makes this one so clear how you treat others is how you can expect to be treated I love these simple truth I love how basic principles are they're almost shocking that when you when you look at a principle it almost seems too easy and then you begin to wonder well why am I doing it like I know I meant to treat others the way I want to be treated but I don't not on the 101 all right not impressed with the golden rule okay let's go to let's go to principle number three say what you mean I love how Jesus reiterates this Matthew 5:37 but let your yes be yes and your no be no for whatever is more than these is from the evil one just say yes or say no don't don't don't keep people like on red like just waiting man we've got an epidemic in our culture where people just say hey you're going to come to this thing and you're like oh maybe let me see I'll get back to you just say no like what are you worried about disappointing them no you're disappointing them as it is just say no can't make it cool I'll stop hassling you they have to have some like really cool excuse you know it's like oh I got to uh you do this thing and and that it's like no you don't now now you're adding lying into it just be like no and they say why because Matthew 5:37 says let your yes be yes and your no be no be direct don't mislead you got to tell the truth at all costs number number four order is imperative Matthew 6:33 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well it's always God first and everything else after that that's a Biblical principle number five direct your finances or your finances will direct you Matthew 6:21 for where your treasure is your heart will be also that means invest wisely invest wisely I want to speak to all the investors invest wisely don't just invest in things that will create gains because where you actually you invest your heart will be connected you got to be mindful of what you connect your heart to there's going to be many things that will get a quick gain but do you want your heart connected to that product do you want your heart connected to that company that organization I'm just little pastoral advice invest invest wisely number six what you sow you reap I know these are basic but 2 Corinthians 9:6 says remember this whoever SE sparingly will also reap sparingly whoever SWS generously will also reap generously I feel like I'm giving you all the classic Bible verses today I'm not even giving you anything you haven't heard before but they're basic biblical principles that if you actually apply them to your life they will produce fruit did you hear that if you apply them to your life they will produce fruit principles are like seed principle is a potential that if applied in other words to make these principles have an effect in my life I have to put them into practice you see a principle is a fundamental truth that produces a Divine system of cooperation between heaven and Humanity let me read let me say that again a principle is a fundamental truth that produces a Divine system of cooperation between heaven and Humanity A A promise is God's doing a principle is my participation in fact this is what makes us good stewards is one who lives by principles now now that's the difference here between a a promise and a principle is for for a principle to come to pass God's looking for our participation both do you know both promises uh and and and principles require belief it's just that one requires Revelation the other one requires application when it comes to the promise of God I've just got to get the Revelation God's going to do it I put my trust in him I apply my faith I don't lose confidence I I stay in faith I don't go into fear if God said it I'm going to every day believe it that he's going to make it happen if God spoke it it's a promise I'm going to stand on that I'm not going to cow I'm not going to lose all my my stuff I'm not going to get worried and frantic oh no I don't know what God's Pro no I know what God's promised so even though I don't see it I'm standing firm on the promise but guess what you don't stand on a principle you apply a [Music] principle you don't just stand on a principle you apply a principle you live a princip principle you act on the principle you you have an application element to your life let let me close out with a story from scripture because in Genesis 22 we have look Abraham who actually is pretty happy with his promise by the way remember Abraham he's the guy who got the promised son he was meant to be the father of many nations and and yet he didn't have a son had an old wife and baron womb and there was no way that he could make it happen but God still promised and so what Abraham did is he did what we meant to do with the promise he stood on the promise he stood firm in the fact that if God said it he'll do it and then we see that the promise came to pass and now you got Abraham who's pretty pumped about his promise could you imagine how pumped you would be I mean I I know I know fathers when they just get like one kid and and they get and they're like so excited and they're like 28 years old but but like when you're a 100 years old and you've been waiting on that promise you're pretty pumped with that promise and he's so excited about the promise however what you find is that God is just as interested in us living out his principles as he is in US experiencing his promises because while there is a lot that God does for us his plan is actually that we would participate like there's a lot that God does for us but there's so much more that God wants to do through us and for him to do through us it requires our participation and so check this out we've got Genesis and you got Abraham he's pretty pumped about the promise and then it says this in Genesis 22:1 after these things God tested Abraham he said to him Abraham he said here I am I love the conversation he said take your son your only son Isaac whom you love and go to lariah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I shall tell you now let me pause here because I'm not sure what you expected the response here should be from Abraham but Abraham's on a whole another level because he doesn't say hey God are you sure he doesn't say God I'm I'm not really confident if I'm hearing you right you don't even say I think I had some bad Curry last night it could be that no he's just like okay just says okay verse three so Abraham Rose early in the morning saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac and he cut the wood for the burnt offering and Rose and went to the place which God had told him on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar then Abraham said to his young men stay here with the donkey and and the boy and I will go over there and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the wood the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son and he took his son sorry his hand the fire and the knife and so they went both of them together and Isaac said to his father Abraham my father and he said here I am my son he said behold the fire and the wood we got them but but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering Abraham said God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering my son so so they both went on together what you might have missed and you might know the story is that right at the last minute God provides right at the last minute God provides but it was at the last minute that God provided but the principle is said right here the principle that Abraham was living by was God will provide but he still had to apply the principle in order for God to he had to be prepared to sew the seed that God gave he gave him a son and God said oh oh you thought that was that was it no that was the seed would you bring the seed that's your first son it's like your you're tired that's your first 10th would you bring the first back to me and watch as you give it to me I'm going to provide but you're looking at the seed going oh God I don't know if you're going to provide seed like this this seed's pretty good I'm pretty happy with this seed I'm pretty stoked with this new role like I got this new job and I love the paycheck but but God I don't I'm not so sure I mean I know you did it once I don't know if you can do it again Abraham knew you provided one son you could do that again you provided once before you could do it again I know it's weird because it's a sun and you can't replace it but but you understand the principle that God was trying to reiterate in the word that God said I provided you with a sun but I provided you with seed would you bring your seed and apply the principle and watch what I will do and he says to his son son don't worry God will provide God will provide and right at the last minute he did why because Abraham lived by the principle he lived by the principle that if I take my seed my seed will stay limited but God wasn't calling Abraham to be a father he was calling him to be a father of many nations so it couldn't stop at one son or just some seed it had to go beyond one son son to multiply to multiply to multiply it would have stayed dormant as one seed but as he began to sew the seed by principle it actually produced the multiplication that God had intended God's good on his promise but are we great in the principle God's looking for participant you want to know the plan of God let me make it as plain as possible God's plan is your participation [Music] God's plan is your participation God's plan is that he would not just do for you but he would bring you in and say let's do this together watch what we're going to do together you know what's how this is going to roll I'm going to give you the seed and you're going to sew the seed and what you're going to see through sewing the seed is the multiplied effect of what I gave you as I put my power in your hands and you can be part of the journey then you don't just sit there and go wow God provided for me there's no Revelation like the fact that God works through me something powerful when you realize God you chose me and you called me and you want to flow through me God you you are magnificent you're a mighty God but that's the plan that you would participate that you would participate that you would take the principles of God and you would apply them to your life [Music]", "hey Welcome to our brand new series called seed stage this is our finance Series where we're taking it all the way back to seed stage really focusing on how the finance that we have is seed that God can use as we begin to sew it we're going to begin to see blessing in our world and I know you're going to be blessed as a result of this sermon so dig in and enjoy so we're going to get into a brand new series called seed stage seed stage and uh I want you to open up with me to second Corinthians this is going to be the the place that we park ourselves and start from or plant from here in this seed stage series now I got to prepare you this ain't a financial Series this is a freedom series the design of this is to get you free and to set you free get some flow in and through your life and so I want to set the framework from that from second Corinthians chapter 9 let's go ahead and read from verse 10 it says he who supplies seed to the Sewer and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sewing and increase the Harvest of your righteousness you will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way which through us will produce Thanksgiving to God verse 12 for the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the Saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God you know I got to prepare your hearts cuz as I kick off this series I want to prepare you to expect some highly practical teaching around Financial stewardship but to do that we're going to have to kind of explore some deeply spiritual principles over the coming weeks and I got to prepare you because it's called seed stage the seed is good my question is how's the [Music] soil that's good the seed is good but how's the soil that means how's how's your heart how's your your mind how are you ready to receive what God wants to do because God prepares the seed we prepare the soil amen so I want you to do something in fact I want you to take that question find your four favorite people around you and ask them how's your soil would you do it real quick just tell ask them how is your soil how's your come on San Jose come on Oakland Let's Go San Francisco how's the how's the soil amen amen I want to speak to you today from the subject well supplied well supplied in fact I'm a little exhausted this morning because our youth pastors came over last night and uh we hung out with Pastor Ben and Jackie and it was fun it was fun to have him over and uh you know my wife did something really strange man I don't know if your wives are in the habit of doing this but we were just chilling in the living room and we had we actually had the fireplace place on just to make it feel more full like uh it was not cold enough for a fireplace but regardless we had it going and uh we were just chilling and then out of nowhere comes my wife with photo albums I'm like I don't know what possessed her to do that but she just jumps on the couch and she has these photo albums and so she's got our wedding photo album she's showing pastors Ben and Jackie our wedding photos they're going down memory lane and then it goes to our our youth ministry photo days where she's just explaining everything that we used to do in our youth ministry and it was fun to to to remember and to kind of reflect on all the good things God did in youth ministry but I was kind of conflicted because if I'm going to be honest with you today there was a season of youth ministry that was the most difficult season of our life financially financially like we we were living paycheck to paycheck and sometimes the paycheck didn't even last to the next paycheck you know I'm talking those five we months it's like whoa whoa whoa there's a gap and and we had like we we we had just had the Twins and so we had three young kids and we were we were invited to go full-time into Ministry and so that meant that our only source of income was the church and I remember it was it was like I was down for it I'm like let's go God's going to look after us we're down let's jump let's go for it you know and several months in things got real tight where where the savings was down and and the gap was there every single and you know what it's like when you got new like kids uh brand new baby kids just things happen and you need to buy stuff random things you cannot budget for you cannot plan for they're just expensive all right and and trust me they get more expensive the older they get okay they cost money but but there was this whole Gap where each month we didn't know what to do this one month was so thin that we were we were forecasting how are we gonna how are we gonna even have gas in the car this week so kir and I devised a plan it was Sunday we didn't have we had barely enough gas to get to church I was doing some stuff I think I was teaching that Sunday and and and youed to decided hey let's do this you'll stay home and do a garage sale like a yard sale where we'll we'll sell some of the household items that'll give us get us enough to get through the Gap and I'll go to church and I'll be the man of God and I'll represent us and and I must have had some attitude or or whatever because my pastor said afterward like hey um is everything good I'm like yeah everything's fine and he's like oh he's like um where's Kira I said well if you need to know she's actually making some money for us uh she's selling some stuff and Y selling he's like today I'm like yeah today like because you know Monday's coming I had attitude I was like so bad and uh and he's like on a Sunday like why would she do a yard sale on a Sunday I'm like well because we don't have enough money he's like why don't you have enough money I said oh this is my moment because you don't pay us enough that's the facts and I I was I went in I was like we don't earn enough money I hav a pay rise we've been here for a while I don't have enough money to pay each month I got small kids now our our expenses have added and we're still on the same amount of money we don't have enough money I remember he so calmly and so pastorally looked at me and said oh am I you provider now I was ready to say yes like pretty sure it's the church on the pay um yeah but I didn't I wanted to but I didn't because in that moment something shifted dynamically within me when he said that sentence that sentence resonated in such a way that it didn't just shift my perspective it shifted me when he said am I your provider something clicked and I'm hoping that today that same thing that clicked Within Me will click within you in fact I want to go on this series and and I want you to stay with me in fact I need you to lean in today I really need you to lean into what God wants to do because I want to reveal that God is your provider and I want to start this series in the best fashion I can by maybe reframing our orientation or our relationship towards money and to do that I cannot think of a better place to start from than with the understanding of what the Bible actually says about it now now truthfully I'm not all that convinced that that all that many Believers actually have a healthy orientation towards finances especially the way God intends us to so let's do something let's begin by building a healthy framework today can we do that are you down for the journey at least let me do this let's p one Sunday in and you decide if you want to come back for the rest of the series let's do that I'm will to do that if God doesn't speak to you today clock off don't come back for the rest of the series maybe come back for baptism Sunday but but for the rest of it if you think you know everything that's fine but I I'm planning on teaching you some stuff that God has been unpacking for me and I want to begin by building a healthy framework and the first thing you need to know this is fundamental if you're going to take notes this is the place to start I would get you to write this down God owns everything God owns everything let me show you scripturally Deuteronomy says this in chapter 10:14 to the Lord your God belong the heavens even the highest Heavens the Earth and everything in it so what that means is God owns it all everything belongs to God it's all his which means that through Divine partnership he has entrusted you you and I we stewarding what's his for his purpose so often we're going to get stalled if we think what I've got is mine when you think what you've got belongs to you you're going to be very precious about what you've got but when you realize what's in your hands is simply God's that he has entrusted you to Steward you're going to act differently to the way that God has called you to act and ultimately knowing that God owns every everything means we also understand that God is not in lack God is he he ain't in lack in fact God is not in need of anything he he he has no needs he's all sufficient within himself acts chap 17:25 reveals this it says human hands can't serve his needs for he has no needs he himself gives life and breath to everything he satisfies every need God is a giver not a getter God doesn't need anything nothing you can give to God is what he needs in fact God doesn't even need your worship that's a pretty jacked up perspective of worship like man God needs My Worship I better come and worship God it's been a minute you know it's been a couple days been five six days and now it's Sunday I better give God what he he he needs no no no no no he doesn't need Worship You Need To Worship You need your perspective shifted you need your perspective elevated you need to elevate and magnify and glorify God to remind you that what's for you is greater than what's against you that's what worship does you need it not God God's not anxiously in heaven going man I'm really feeling like a deficit right now uh my people really haven't acknowledged me and it's been seven days no no no God doesn't need anything he don't need it you need it you need it because God's a giver he is he he is he is all sufficient within himself now what's really cool for every Christian to understand is that we have been made to reign with Christ as coars with him with which also then means that lack can no longer be a limiting factor for what God can and what God wants to do in our lives that if we've been made to reign with Christ and if God owns everything then we have access to everything God has I wanted to go real quick but I feel like I have to slow it down we are coair with Christ and for way too long I feel like too many Believers have operated with what's called a scarcity mindset especially when it comes to finances can I just Camp here for a second and make sure I unpack what a scarcity mindset is because sometimes you don't know what it is until you actually identify it and there's a label to it so then you can realize that's what it is it's a scarcity mindset it's it's a mindset where where you have a way of thinking or or a worldview that is framed with with limitation and while it understandably exists among unbelievers it becomes very confusing when you see it in the life of a Believer you see a scarcity mindset is a particular pattern of thinking it's it's a a pattern of thinking that is polarized by lack by limitation and by fear of not having enough or maybe you're going to run out which ultimately will negatively affect your your ability to be generous and even the way that you see and spend money will be affected by a scarcity mindset you'll be you'll be so worried about losing that you won't let go you'll be unable to be generous you you'll commiserate with people in their loss but you won't be a solution to their need because you're worried that if I give to them then I do without see an unbeliever can certainly be charitable an unbeliever can be philanthropic maybe they're compelled by a sense of compassion or maybe a sense of of guilt but but it's truly the realm of the believer that is generous since the orientation of the believer is kingdom and they possess the very nature of God that's what it takes to be truly generous you see when you when you look at what you've got as limited you actually see money as security instead of seeing God as your Source when you when you look at what you've got as limited you sto and you hoard instead of investing when you look at what you've got as limited you prioritize the promotion of self and and you subtly allow greed to grow in your life I don't know where to I don't know how hard to push this morning I feel like feel like I am I feel like I am trying to confront some things I'm trying to get that moment within you I'm trying to get that confrontation moment where you reassess how have I viewed things things what what what have how have I seen the way I view the world and what God wants to do in and through my my finances you allowed a greed to grow in life that's because a a scarcity mindset is actually in direct opposition to a stewardship mindset it makes us stingy it makes us selfish and it will ultimately prevent the flow of finances in your life in fact a scarcity mindset check this out goes beyond just someone's approach to money it actually affects their approach to people can I Elevate this for a moment can we Zig for a moment because we're going towards finances let me go towards your relationships when a scarcity mindset affects every era of your life you see a scarcity mindset isn't just the feeling of never having enough it also reveals your inability to be happy when others succeed you you just can't be happy for people you you can't celebrate their wins you want to but you feel like because because your mind is framed from from from the fact that that their promotion is threatening my promotion that their achievement is affecting what I could get in life preventing you from really celebrating any of their accomplishments you see a scarcity mindset will blame others you don't pay me enough scar scarcity mindset will blame others I'm just preaching this because I've lived it I was in Ministry with a scarcity mindset I was operating with the blaming others for my position and that's what a scarcity mindset will do it will blame others for your position because you ultimately believe that life is a zero sum game in other words that success is a fixed pie and for you to get your peace means someone has to miss out on their piece because there's only so much pie that can go around that's a scarcity mindset that is not a stewardship mindset or understanding that there is no lack for those that are in Christ Jesus and that's the truth you're not in lack the Bible is emphatic about this by the way can I just spit a few scriptures at you just to show you that the Bible is so emphatic and reiterating this time and time again 1 Corinthians Chapter 1:7 says therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly await for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed Ephesians 1:3 praise be to God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us in the Heavenly Realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ second Corinthians 98 says and God is able to bless you abundantly so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work I hope you wrote them down in fact the reason a True Believer is truly generous is because they fundamentally believe the principle of MTH Matthew 10 which is freely you have received so freely you give free that's a principle freely you have received because I've receive freely I give freely there's a flow in my life because what I got I didn't deserve but God gave it I can give it freely because God gave me what I didn't deserve thanks s you see this is an abundance or a stewardship mentality so a scarcity mindset is not only anti-biblical it's no way beneficial for your life however I don't want you to be confused this morning because while we're not meant to live with a scarcity mindset the Bible certainly calls us to live a with a sacrificial mindset I want to show you what I mean with some scripture in fact I I so badly wanted to call this series seed stage specifically for the purpose of what I believe God is calling us back to for many of us to to to re reset an opportunity to reset our perspectives around finances and go back to the seed stage in our life you see in investing the the seed stage to me is by far the most exciting stage for a developing company or for a Founder because it's the foundational stage it's the building block stage and if you build it right it will flourish and when you're at the seed stage as a Believer if you could actually rebuild your your understanding and your base financially right you will begin to flourish and at the seed stage every single founder knows or they should know that the money you receive in your seed investment is actually not for spending the money you receive at a seed investment is for sewing it's not the stage to spend that comes at the exit go ball out buy stuff but the seed is not for spending it's for sewing that's where you're setting things in motion that's where you're making Investments to build upon it's a sewing mentality not a spending mentality and this is so important for the life of a Believer not just the life of a Founder that God calls us to set up a seed stage mentality when it comes to our financial plan this isn't just for for for for us Paul was trying to press this into the Corinthians and this is what he's saying in the scripture that we're building upon today that they would first and foremost know who their Source was it says if we go back to verse 10 of 2 Corinthians 9 it says he everyone say he he he who supplies seed check this out to the SE and bread for food so the seed and this bread will supply and multiply your seed for sewing and increase the Harvest of your righteousness what Paul does here is he reminds the church that from the very start God is the source of your supply he supplies it and check it out he is the one who multiplies it now now let let me say this this is why the tithe is so important and so significant for every believer because when we bring the tithe from our income and from our increase back to God we actually stay connected and reminded that God is our source see refusing to tithe and I know I know that sounds strange to you like like what Believers what Believers would refuse to tithe I mean in the Bible believe it or not there's some Believers that refuse definitely not in VI church but but there are believers around the world that just refuse to tithe what that is is forming an anti-rip theology regarding the tithe because it's going of refusing to tithe develops an independent Spirit like I don't need that I'm I'm self-made it's an elevation of self refuses to acknowledge God as your Source now I came into today fully expecting some silent moments in church CU I know what you want to hear Pastor preach a finance series that doesn't require me to do anything can you pray that prayer of blessing from Heaven Can you can you pray that gold coins from Heaven you know open the windows of Heaven let it just finances falling into my life I don't have a prayer like that but I have got some practical teaching that will unlock the finances in your life if you put it into practice I got that I I got that because the he who he who supplies the seed the it's the tithe is what keeps you confident no matter what the financial climate w it serves as that constant reminder that God is my source translating into a new level of freedom in the area of my finan this is why the tithe positions you to prosper there I go I said that word to to prosper God wants you to to prosper he wants to shift your perspective but but Paul he isn't just wanting you to know who supplies you he wants the church to know what he supplies you with check it out he says he who supplies seed to the SE and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sewing and increase the Harvest of your righteousness now I think this might be very helpful to illustrate this today because I know some of youall are visual Learners so could I bring out my seed bag for a moment can we get the seed bag out here because I I know my church I definitely know San Jose we are visual Learners in in church and so I've got I got the seed back because this is what scripture says that there are two things that God supplies he supplies Seed and Feed seed to the sewer and bread for food now being able to differentiate between the two I'm going to go out and say is potentially the greatest thing I can give you in unlocking your finances especially if you're currently living paycheck to paycheck however it's difficult to differentiate because they look the same to know what's feed and to know what's seed the problem is we're too way too busy eating the seed which leaves nothing to multiply yeah this is one of the silent moments just I knew this was going to be the silent moment you know what you actually can't you can't multiply what you consume you can only multiply what you sow okay come on I got an illustration here the seed bag maybe I could maybe I could do this's let's just turn this just for like a couple of minutes into a financial seminar I'll give you some free financial advice you don't have to go to millionaire mindset you know have to go and pay Tony Robbins or whatever you do to go and get your budgeting advice I'm just going to give you some basic financial literacy that's going to help you because I know that most people have a paycheck mentality that's a one portion mentality when it comes to finances and that's cool have a paycheck but but at a basic level you should have a six portion mentality when it comes to finances paycheck is one of them you should also add principles like we've been speaking about the tithe and generosity as another portion of your financial plan beyond that you should actually add properties you should have a plan to get some real estate assets that should be in your in your plan in your budget you should have uh people that's a good investment who's your people investment your Partnerships your friendships your education you need a product product or products you know something that you actually make and sell or something you import and sell higher preferably something you sell while you're sleeping on Amazon or something like that just make it work for you amen while you're catching Z's dollar signs whatever it is you know just you should have you should have products you should have a portfolio I'm talking about stocks maybe crypto if you're daring uh maybe maybe Commodities maybe currencies should be a multifaceted element or portions to your income but so often we think limited because I'm thinking paycheck I'm pay thinking paycheck and and when we often think paycheck to get me to the next paycheck you might be saying a pastor I love the ID I love the P's I love the literation I love the the different elements or the portions of a financial plan but how am I going to get to properties how am I going to get a portfolio how am I going to get to to products when when when I can't even get through to the end of my P paycheck and make it last okay great question well to start with you got to define the difference between what's seed and what's feed and as I said this is difficult because they come in the same bag and so what I eat is feed and what I sew is seed and just as the feed often is not enough but as a seed I'm actually well supplied if I look at my my pay check in my income as this is what I have to live off I'm going to approach my bag as I've got a limited Supply now we G to make this last we're going to make this stretch it's a five month five week month five month week it's a five week month honey we're going to make this stretch no hair this week you're not doing your hair this month sorry no no no no hair dude no colors you know no we're going no no you're going to I I got to live what's out of the the the bag because we're going to make that stretch and it's limited as feed but if I start to look at it as seed I got a bag of potential I got I got something that God can begin to multiply this is the principle of sewing Andi it's such a simple principle in fact one of the most basic principles in the Bible is the One sewing and reaping everyone knows this if you SE sparingly you can if you s sparingly you'll that's not a difficult principle to understand so why don't we do it it's not because we don't believe the principle it's probably simply because we've eaten the seed and I got nothing left to seow I love these moments of obscurity I love the moments of reflection because I got to reflect have I been eating the seed and am I blaming my employer as my provider am I looking at my situation as stuck and limited now the reality is I'm not going to I'm not trying to I'm not trying to live with a scarcity mindset but I I understand that we still have a limited Supply that's the reality and with all my commitments mortgages and insurances and all the things I understand sometimes there just not much margin I understand so I want to do something and I want to show you scripturally that margin actually isn't determined by how much you make because I know what you're thinking automatically great I would love to get to a sewing mentality but I got to make some more money great idea if you can but margin isn't determined by how much you make because you could make more and still be in the same position I found you make more you spend more no no no Marin doesn't come from how much you make Marin comes from how you manage what you make stay with me stay with me I want to show you in scripture because if you turn with me to John chapter 6 what you're going to find in John chapter 6 is one of the greatest miracles of multiplication that you're actually going to find in scripture this is a story that is recorded through all four gospels but I really love the way John's gospel kind of hits at it because John comes straight to the point and it's in John chapter 6:4 bear with me I know you've heard this I know you've been to you know kids church growing up and you know this story but just bear with me because John takes a different angle he says now the Passover the Feast of the Jews was at hand lifting up his eyes then and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him Jesus said to Phillip where are we to buy bread so that these people may eat he said this to test him for he himself knew what he would do Philip answered him 200 dinari worth of bread would not be enough for each of them them to get a little one of his disciples Andrew make note of Andrew Simon Peter's brother said to him well there is a boy here who has five barley Loaves and two fish but what are they for so many and Jesus said have the people sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down about 5,000 in number Jesus then took the Loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed them to those who were seated so all so also the fish as much as they wanted verse 12 and when they had eaten their fill he told the disciples gather up the leftover fragments that nothing may be lost so they gathered them up and they filled the 12 baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten now I know you know the story I know you've heard the story preached in many different ways but so often what we miss is the perspective of the writer who's writing the story John isn't just retelling the stories that the other gospel writers told John's telling the story from a different perspective John centers his perspective actually around Andrew Andrew he includes what Andrew brings to the table as Jesus declares hey how are we gonna feed these people you got Philip over here saying yeah that's that's not going to happen Phillip like man let me just do a quick calculation no we don't have enough Andrew brings something to the table but then dismisses it as not enough Andrew has the the thought of an idea what if we what if we use this the little that we've got but then against the magnitude of what was needed it it seemed it seemed small now I got to tell you this what I love about the way John reveals this story is he he makes it clear that Jesus had a plan that he knew very well what he was going to do he he was going to multiply and I feel like this is so important for all of us to understand that God knows exactly what he's going to do in your life especially for those today that are frustrated in their finances maybe living paycheck to paycheck I do have to let you know that God's got a plan that God has a plan in your life to multiply that God has actually put everything within your hands to fulfill the plan that he's got for you to multiply that God's plan is not some external Source adding to what you've got but that you would manage what he's already given so that you would get free and that God would glorify be glorified through the process of you managing not necessarily making more you got you got Phillip counting how much they need you got Andrew who who who sees he sees some seed but it seems small it seems small you know what's fascinating because I remember the seed stage of Vive church when we first got started you know I've shared this before but when we started the church we didn't have a lot we we uh no one would would really fund us and so we had to sell what we had we had to sell stuff back to the yard sale uh and uh is how proven mechanism by the way uh and uh we we just we sold stuff right we just sold all the things that we had and we gathered the money that we had and and uh I I remember I remember coming uh here to the states and one of my first appointments was with a another church leader and he was kind enough and gracious enough to meet with us we just brand new in the bit Bay Area and we're just kind of getting to know people and through the conversation uh he wanted to know how much we had had to start with what was our our our planning budget and so we said pretty boldly $60,000 and he he he literally laughed because they had planted a few years earlier with a million dollars they had been funded because they were coming from the south and they're going to Big Bad San Francisco and everyone was like well I don't want to go but you go here's money you know what I mean and uh and so they they came became well funded and and and at first he thought we were joking when we said 60,000 so he started laughing and then we started laughing but we didn't know what we were laughing about so then when we all stopped laughing he's like oh you're serious I said yeah I'm not joking we got 60,000 like let keep laughing um and and and he was he was literally shocked and went into concern mode now I don't want to give you all the details but from then to to now God has blessed this ministry God has blessed the church God has expanded and increased now I don't want to say that God hasn't blessed their Ministry but I got to tell you that that that it wasn't their money they were giving other people's money you can't be expected to be blessed of what you don't s of yours I can take your money and invest it don't worry about that but you're going to reap the benefits not me it's the same with the kingdom of God I get I got to I got a seed to sew I can't sew somebody I got to se sew my seed we got you know what we got so addicted to sewing after I had that conversation with my pastor and things jolted within me it was crazy like I had like it was like a snap to my spine I was like man I got to man I got to change everything I went home and we said honey we're going to we've been seeing we've been seeing our bag of seed we're going to start doing it as seed I literally said we're going to start seeing it as seed so we're going to start we're going to start sewing some stuff and we got addicted to sewing we started we we went crazy we started like managing all our finances we started like we we went through like with with line items in our budget we just started Crossing stuff out don't need that nice to have but don't need it we literally started to get our finances in order in such a way that we start have seed to sew we got so addicted to sewing the the day that we left the last Sunday that were in our church that were going through a building campaign and we'll pump for them too we're on the front row cheering let's go and we were so excited and they did the moment it was like the vision giving where they called people to give sacrificially and and I was like go guys do it get out there give big and and then Kira literally open me say honey what are we giving I'm like oh honey everything if you want to know actually we're going to America remember like tomorrow and uh we're we're we're going to start a church so pretty much everything we've got going to God you know and she's like yeah no no no I know that but what are we giving here and I said oh you silly girl you don't know how this you don't know how this financial thing works you know like uh we're already committed to everything and we're sure there so if we give more he we'll be even shorter there and she's like no no I understand what do we giving he what what are we sewing i g I had that jolt in my spirit I almost forgot our plan to sew our way through to sew our way through and so we end up well I wrote a check and then K was like oh is call that I'm so we wrote a biger check I was a little bit mad about it too oh was was a little bit mad about it because it was actually more than what the church had given us there was someone back in but God has blessed every single step of the Journey of stepping out and sacrificing and seeing his provision God has led the way and still today and in 4 weeks time we're going to come around the vision I know God's going to lead again I know God's going to provide again because because the chain reaction of sewing not seeing our bag as feed but seeing it as seed seeing it as a potential seeing it as what God can do if we actually don't eat the seed but we sew the seed being able to differentiate between what's seed and what's feed I got to eat some I got bills to pay I got mortgage but the way I get out of a scarcity mindset is by adapting a sacrifice mindset you see we had to go through our budget and to get into a position where we had seed we had to sacrifice some things we had to sacrifice some nice haves we had to sacrifice some stuff so that we could make margin in our world now let me educate you with what sacrifice is in the Bible sacrifice biblically is not giving God your [Music] leftovers sacrifice biblically is bringing the best not the rest it's the best portion it was the first part it was the and this is why because if you see feed first then seed you'll never have enough to sew the unexpected will come rot and famine the Bible says will come and you'll be giving you'll be putting it in your pockets with holes in it you'll find that why am I getting to the end and there's not enough because you've got the sacrifice the wrong way you're saying God if there's left over then I'll give it God says that's not sacrifice sacrifice biblically is first foremost best not rest so if I actually say I'm going to actually margin my seed for sewing First Watch as God expands the rest watch as God does something to your finances where not only does he make that stretch but you begin to yield multiplication on what was swn not what was [Music] consumed", "hey welcome to Vive Church you have found us in our series called made this series comes from John one it's a thrilling series an exciting series and I know that God is going to bless you as a result so enjoy I'm in a serious and I want to bring the final installment today so would you go with me one more time to our our series scripture in John chapter one if you want to grab your Bibles let's stay standing for the reading of God's word it's gonna be the final time we read this for this series you can still read it anytime you want on your own but for this series it says in John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God he was with God in the beginning through him all things were made without him nothing was made that has been made in him was life and that life was the light of all mankind the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness has not overcome it let me read that final verse the light shines in the Darkness and the Darkness has not overcome it I want to close out this series with a simple sermon titled today which is made to win made to win you're ready for this installment all right if you're ready I want you to do something real real quick find five of your favorite people and if you believe you're made to win convince them they're made to win go real quick tell them you're made to win you're made to win go go go thanks worship team so I need to mention that it's my wife's birthday weekend she is the finest 42 year old I've ever laid eyes on and uh you know what you need to know is I know my wife I take great joy in knowing my wife I'm a studier of Kira smokeham I have learned her ways I uh I have been stalking her for no I mean I've been watching her uh for a long time now and there is there's just things I know about Kira and we know this dynamic in our marriage we talk about a lot that I know her she hardly knows me it's because I'm mysterious or random one of the two you know it's kind of similar but but she's a creature of habit and I and I know I know Kira I know how to I know how to get the mood right for Kira if you just play 80s Australian hit songs man something happens she comes in she becomes a new person she starts singing ballads and she starts she knows every single lyric if you want to play meatloaf you wanna you wanna any anything I'm telling you anything from the 80s she is an aficionado on all things 80s hits but I don't care so much that I even know what she likes before she likes it it's very handy when it comes to buying birthday gifts because if I was to ask Carol what birthday gift would you want she would be like I don't know anybody know those kinds of people there's two types of people in this world there's the the people that don't know what they want and the people who have a list and before hey what would you they give you the list here is the I don't know person which means is a test do you know me that's the test but guess what I have passed that test so many freaking times I know her I know her better than she knows herself so much so that I don't even ask her what she wants for her birthday I just buy her stuff point in case is the gift that I gave her this week which is a Garmin watch you know the kind of watch you track your your data and your workouts and the technical stuff you're looking at me like you don't know what a Garmin watch is get physical people all right it's a Garmin watch you know and you track your steps and you can track your workouts and you can you can join the Run club with it there's so many things that you can do with the Garment and at first when when I was given to her she's like what is this what what are you getting there I'm like trust me trust me you're gonna love it and sure enough she loves it literally like now she is addicted to tracking her sleep she's tracking so her heart rate she's like oh oh I got a 95 today that means 95 that she had a good night's sleep as if you needed your watch to tell you that but it's like a game for her now she loves her Garmin watch but with her watch that she didn't even know she wanted there's a learning curve like how to use it which by the way reminds me of so many believers that most of the time you either don't know what you've got or if you know what you've got you don't know how to use it do you like that connection that's that's the way it is with most Believers is that you either don't know what you've got or you don't know how to use it and I want to be a really good pastor today and do my job to make sure on the final installment of this Made series you know firstly exactly what it is you you have as a Believer and secondly you would know how to use what it is that you have been given and I want to make sure you know this and I want to help you specifically with a significant element of your Christianity which is called your Christian victory now are we here I'm talking about your Christian victory I'm not just talking about your passivity I'm not talking about your redundancy I'm talking about the victory that is yours in Christ Jesus all right we're gonna we're gonna be like that okay okay let me let me wind this back a bit because what we know about John 1 over the past several weeks we have been discovering as John reveals that Jesus being the word of God was present at creation when things began to be made that they began to be made by the word of God and as the word of God went forth and in his opening few verses John reveals that in him Jesus was life itself and and he goes on to say that Darkness has not overcome it so in other words what John does is he does something absolutely remarkable and he in the verse 5 in one verse I want to draw your attention to it he presents two opposing elements light and darkness and at the same time he reveals that there is an ongoing battle between the two in John's words he says the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness has not overcome it now what you've got to understand about the nature of light is that the nature of light repels Darkness light by Nature pushes out Darkness when there is darkness and you bring light Darkness has to go okay so John what he does is he personifies both light and darkness as life and death and in this one verse he masterfully summarizes his entire gospel by revealing that the light which is Jesus has invaded the Dominion of Darkness has overcome Satan who was powerless to defend it revealing the word of God as Victorious that was a lot what what he was doing in this one verse he summarizes his entire gospel if you read through John you're going to actually find that the whole the whole idea of John the concept of John what John is trying to unpack is revealed in verse five like a preview he says the light entered the world through the word the word is Jesus and and what Jesus did is he pushed back darkness in the beginning of time before the world was created the Bible says that the world was void and without form and darkness covered the Earth But as God began to create the Bible says he spoke light and light came and as he spoke light light began to push back Darkness and the enemy has not been able to defeat it he hasn't been able to defeat it therefore the word of God is Victorious now something you need to know from here from the connection between John 1 and Genesis 1 is that we have been made in His image trying to give you some background here we have been made now now if you've been part of this series for the whole series you would already understand that when the Bible says that you are Made In His Image he's not it's not talking about appearance because because God is spirit so it's not that you look like God I mean you look good today but you don't look like God you don't look that good but but it's not talking about appearance it's talking about nature that you are made with the nature of God do you have God characteristics when you when you are born again you are born into a new nature a nature a god-like nature a Godly nature so you are born with the characteristics and the Very nature of God it's a Victorious nature it's what Paul presents to the Corinthians when saying the Corinthians of First Corinthians 15 55 he says o death where is your Victory oh death where is your sting this thing of death is sin and the power of sin is the law but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ so what the Apostle is doing is the Apostle as closing out his letter to the Corinthian Church he decides to conclude the letter with the reminder that they have been given a new nature and the trademark of that nature is Victory okay stay with me I want to go to Pace today that wasn't as Furious as the first service I want to make sure I take everyone on the journey today sometimes I can get ahead of myself because we're talking about the Victorious nature we have in Christ Jesus I get a little excited so I'm going to Pace myself and make sure we all take notes and we all go along the journey together because you're going to need this you're going to need this you might not need it right now because it's Sunday morning and the victory has already been one for you and so you come into a Victorious setting everything's happy everything's Mighty you feel in Victorious you want to fight but Monday morning the fight's coming to you you're going to need to know this and you want to whip out your notes and if you're not taking notes you're going to go where are my notes you don't have them I want you to have them you need to know that you have been given a new nature believe it or not this is extremely important for every single believer to know that that to know what it is that you've been given I want to make sure I help you but understanding is that the truth of the matter is you have you have a new nature meaning before Christ came into your life you simply had what was called a sin nature that is the nature that you were born with was a sin nature because of the fall in the garden we know this and in that moment we see sin entered the scene and so everybody since that moment born of a woman has been born into sin so your default nature being born was sin nature but because of Christ and his Victorious work on the cross those that are born again are born now with not their just their sin nature but you're born into a new nature which is a Victorious nature thank you Pastor Ben you're with me now now this is important to understand because I know what can be complicated is you like nature I don't know that talk let me substitute for a moment the word nature with capacity because when you without Christ you have an incredible capacity to sin that you are born with this just this capacity to sin if you don't believe me that means you've never seen a two-year-old tantrum they just have a capacity to sin to go mental you have this capacity to go crazy it's just in your nature because you were born with that capacity now now this isn't this is important because this is not only unique to unbelievers by the way because even as a Believer you also have this capacity that's why as even as a Believer you have you have to time struggle with sin I know why we're so quiet it's like not me Pastor yes you stop canceling yourself like you're some holier than thou even as Believers we struggle with sin can I get an amen like let's be the real Church let's just get real let's just let pretenses go today no one judging you just go ahead and judge yourself I am a sinner because this is the capacity that we have as unbelievers and as Believers the difference is as an unbeliever an unbeliever cannot resist sinning because they they don't have the capacity to not sin on the other hand the believer while still struggling with sin has the capacity to resist sin because Jesus over came it freeing us from the enslavement to sin this is what Romans 6 6 says by the way can we put that up there Paul wants the church to know that we know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin see see pre-christ you were enslaved you had no choice like a slave whatever sin wanted to do sin did so sin controlled your life but now that you've been set free from sin you are no longer slave the chains have been broken so now you have the choice to sin or not to sin you have the choice you have the the choice now I I can feel that tension I can feel that moment I see you have the choice you're like oh well whoa whoa whoa pasta it sounds it's not so easy well I didn't say it was easy I didn't say it was not difficult but you have the choice if you're born again if you're born again you've been set free so now the choice is yours [Music] maybe I should actually change the word choice if we're changing the word nature to capacity maybe I should change the word choice to battle you can battle against maybe that's more appropriate because it is a battle it ain't easy it is difficult but it's still yours you can battle against it or you can relent to it this is very very clear from scripture that those Born Again are born to win they're born to battle and so the very moment you're born again you receive that new capacity that that new nature and this is the new nature it's one that is Victorious it's given by Jesus so you can battle against and overcome sin simply because when you were born again you were you you were made with the new nature and the new nature is a winning nature it's probably the most basic way I can boil it down sounds sounds average to the Bible scholar but it's the basic way I can do it that you that you've got winning on your side now a good question to ask at this point would be well if if I made to win to win it what to win at work to win at life not exactly because there is actually a significant battle that every believer needs to know how to win but to know how to win this battle you ideally need to identify your enemy now I've been I've been building something for a little while let's say it's a mentoring program for Business Leaders and Executives and it's simply taking all my pastoring tools and my pastoring experience and putting it into the business realm the only difference is I don't have to be as nice in business as I do as a pastor synergistic you know I mean you gotta you gotta let it feed and because as a pastor you're trying to help people understand what God has for them and you have to be really nice because people are resistant to pastoring but in business people are open to it it's crazy it's amazing you just change the Paradigm of people like because Business Leaders and Executives they want to win they're into it they're in it to win it they're like man coach me show me but but Christians are so resistant oh I don't know about that Pastor I don't know if I can do that and so what I did is I've I've taken all the tools and the techniques that you find in scripture and you actually just blamed up business it's amazing and so I've developed this series of of spiritual and and I would say philosophical leadership tools that I'm using now and helping Executives win and one of my favorite ones is philosophy number six yeah you don't know what it is because I haven't taught you yet you're all like ah yeah that one no philosophy number six philosophy number six says it doesn't have to rhyme all the time and I Know It Rhymes that's the whole point I'm clever but it doesn't have to rhyme or the time I developed this tool because I find so many humans who love a quippy statement that they can tattoo on their life or write on their wall that actually doesn't even work but because it Rhymes and it's catchy we love to Peddle it we love to push it we love to own it like man that's my that's my saying and it becomes a statement and a goal for life but it doesn't work like I don't know if you've heard this one but I hear a lot of preachers trying to push this one this is the this is the one they push they push the enemy is the enemy oh God bless that I can beat that the enemy is the enemy that and it sounds so good like I could subscribe to that because I know me I deal with me I look at me every day in the mirror every time I go to step out I got me in my head telling me that I can't do it telling me that I don't have the the pedigree telling me that there's someone better than I know so the enemy feels like the enemy the problem is you are not your enemy the enemy is your enemy the devil is your enemy it's just that the devil sounds like you how else do you think the devil sounds when the Devil comes through your thought life and the Devil comes into your mind it sounds a lot like you that's why it's so successful wow but if you misplace it and you start calling the devil you you'll be battling against you trying to defeat something that cannot be defeated because you're already victorious in Christ Jesus therefore you're just stuck in the place now this whole thing is subtle and seductive because the truth of the matter is a you one of the most dangerous things to the modern Christian is the self-help ideology the self-help like I could subscribe to some self-help technique to be better in this life the problem is you can't help yourself you can't do it you're the one stuck actually the Bible makes it more clear you were dead in your trespasses I don't know if you've encountered many dead people they don't do a lot but when you're dead you need someone to bring life and this is what it was with us in Christ that we were dead in our transgressions we were dead in our trespasses but thanks be to God who saved us from our death who took the penalty of sin and Death on his behalf bringing life into our mortal bodies self-help doesn't work but it sells cells it's perpetuated as cancerous to the Christian faith because I don't need more help from myself I need help from my savior [Music] you know what the self-help uh ideology will do the self-help ideology will get you to just be more independent from God you get you to a place where you say God I got this now God I'm good I got this you got me this far but I got it from here thank you very much let me go and make my own moves you know what the truth of the matter is the longer I walk with Christ the more dependent on him I am like like the more I walk with Christ the more I realize I need you with every step it used to be I need you with every step now I need you with every breath because as I walk with God I realize the magnitude of what he's called me to when before I was ignorant before I was just inferred to winner God I'm with you let's go for it now I realize there's a there's other lives on the other side of this calling now I realize there's a whole when we actually started the church we we were way riskier than we are now like I'll be at like a conference and people tell me oh you know tell us how you move like you guys just do so much Faith stuff you're so risky as a church and I always tell them no we used to be riskier because when we started we really had nothing to lose like we're in a living room that's how we started no one was kicking us out of our living room but we didn't have a mortgage to pay we didn't have nothing we just we're just meeting together and if it didn't work we just start again because we were Nimble and we're small but now we've got stuff to lose I'm more dependent on God than ever I'm way more dependent on God I'm I'm leaning into prayer like I need it now more than it was just a nice to have it's a need to have because I know that on the other side of every decision is weight now because we've got some stuff to lose and that's the maturity in Christ it's not that I'm helping myself but I have a savior that's walking with me and sustaining me and holding me when I don't know what to do and if I don't know what to do I'm playing it safe it's not it's not self-help save your help that's the story of the believer that a savior a savior a savior now of course I understand what it's like that the enemy is the enemy because you're so critical of yourself what's the problem sometimes I feel like we've got to be critical of ourselves like you know someone's sometimes it's not the devil the inner critic sometimes you could be better sometimes it's the Holy Spirit like you know the person who's like oh no just don't be critical of yourself they turn up late to church and they're like oh no I'm late nope it's fine no be better be be like you know what thank you Holy Spirit feel the conviction don't be better next week that's hell you're meant to critique I'm meant to be making friends I feel like I'm making enemies okay subtle it's subtle it's subtle because you need a savior it's essentially what Paul is exposing and he's confronting when he writes the Romans and Romans chapter seven check this out I love the tension that Paul brings realistically now but as I read this I need you to remember this is an apostle of Jesus Christ this is the one mandated with the mission to take the gospel to the Gentiles and he says this so the trouble is not with the law it's spiritually good the troubles with me from All Too Human a slave to sin check this out I don't really understand myself folks I want to do what is right but I don't do it instead I do what I hate but if I know that what I'm doing is wrong this shows that I agree that the Lord is good so I'm not the one doing wrong it's sin living in me that doesn't and I know that nothing good lives in me that is in my sinful nature I want to do what is right but I can't I don't want to do what I want to do what it's good but I don't I don't want to do what is wrong but I do it anyway but if I do what I don't want to do I'm not really the one doing wrong it is sin living in me that does it what Paul articulates there is the tension between the new nature and the old nature the sin nature and the Victorious nature that though I'm born again and I'm in Christ Jesus and I now have a new nature being set free from slavery to sin I still have sin living in me it's no longer I that's sinning it's not me my identity but it's still sin dormant in my life it's still sin in my life so there is a process now where I gotta choose sorry I gotta do battle with sin where because I have a new nature and the old nature is still present trying to stay remaining and taking up territory in my life I have to lean into my Victorious nature draw some battle lines and start to say sin we're going to battle sin we're going to war sin it's time to fight that is the position that Paul is presenting he's like I got some stuff in my life that keeps on coming up and it keeps coming back and it keeps rearing its head and I know I'm victorious in Christ Jesus but what I've realized that ain't me it's sin but if the enemy's the enemy I miss the fact that I can't battle me because how do I be victorious if I defeat me no no I'm Victorious but I gotta do battle with sin I gotta draw some lines in my life and I've got to start to war in other words Paul reveals that the real battle the real battle is in overcoming sin I wanted to show you this scripture I forgot to give it to the team I don't know if they got it up there but I found it in the first service and it's uh in in first John I want to read this to you did we end up getting that I forget if I gave it yes we did excellent look at this okay first John chapter three this is a crazy passage I don't know if you can handle this if you're feeling like timid Just Close Your Eyes block your ears that was your warning mystery Bible whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil for the devil has been sinning from the beginning and the reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil no one born of God is born again makes a practice of sinning for God's seed abides in him and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God what John wants to make sure he emphasizes too the Christians is to know that now you have a new nature in Christ which is a Victorious nature the sin that was so dominant in your life you've been set free from so now what was on you are unable to beat before you are now Victorious over now because of Christ and your Victorious nature you have to start to do battle with that that old life you have to start drawing the battle lines and actually start to identify what am I going to go to war against because I can win it is it is unacceptable for a Believer to claim addiction certain things you say that you get the tense you can't say I'm a born-again Believer and then the next breast type oh but I'm addicted to this every addiction is enslavement the crisis set you free from you may still struggle with sin but there is no way that you can be addicted if Christ Reigns in your life because your new nature your old nature was stuck enslaved to sin your new nature is Born Again victorious in Christ Jesus the problem is you just haven't done battle with it you haven't done the battle you haven't drawn the line you've lived with it and you've allowed it and you're saying you know what this is too hard I don't know if I could beat that yeah yeah I'm Victorious but I don't know if I see being Victorious is the first step to know what you've got putting it into practice is the next step to put to work what I've got because apart from Christ you can into nothing however because of second Corinthians chapter five verse 21 which says for God made Christ who never sinned to be the offering for our sins so that we could be made right with God through Christ and because I have this new nature I need to understand I mean so my battle isn't to defeat me my battle is to build me how do we do that I want to show you but to show you I need to show you with an Old Testament passage of scripture look we've got the worship team here I feel like they're ready to battle I'm ready to fight I really want to get you on the battle line as well that's my goal today is not to get you to shrink back from the battle but to step up to the battle and the way I'm going to get you to step up to the battle is to show you what you've got and how to use it because anybody would be prepared to fight if they knew how to fight and they knew what they were fighting with so that is my goal for you as a Believer Born Again In Christ Jesus to know what you have in your hands so that you will actually start to engage with the battle of the sin that's keeping you stuck and stopping you holding you back from all that Christ wants to do in and through your life and what you need to understand is in the Old Testament is that the Old Testament the old Covenant you have what's called types and shadows they're a forecast or a pretense to what you will find and experience in the New Testament so so there are physical battles and physical things that happen in the old Covenant that are illumination of what we can deal with as a spiritual experience in a New Covenant are you with me so what you're going to find and this is going to help you that you're going to find that often in the Old Testament God would call his people the Israelites to go up in battle against the enemy the Israelites were called the people of God the enemy were those that opposed God in his ways and so whether it was the amorites the jebusites the amalekites the Hittites whatever the ice God would call them to go up and he would often say make sure you eradicate them now I've heard a lot of work Christianity who are saying well you know what I just don't know if I can subscribe to the whole Bible because I don't know if I can believe in a Bible that God you know he Advocates genocide that's not what was going on what he was indicating and illustrating if you have the wisdom to apply it into your life this is why you need the Holy Spirit as The Interpreter and the Revelator of scripture is God was revealing that the same way that they disobeyed God and they often did where they would leave some of the enemy and they would make sure they would bring them into their homes and they would make them into their servants and they would even marry some of the enemy at times it was an indicator that if you do this in your life where you leave areas of your life in sin and you don't address it and you don't eradicate it it will be the very thing that ends up corrupting your life or keeping you stuck still having to go around and around and around again so he gives us an Old Testament picture of what happens in a New Covenant setting though we can apply spiritually so now you know that background I need to show you in Deuteronomy but before we go to Deuteronomy let me give you the New Covenant picture of the Old Testament setting can I do that real quick because we read it earlier in in Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 15 worship 10 come up with me because I'm going to need you and I need you everyone's quiet I'm gonna need you and I need you first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 57 says but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ so hold that in your mind be thanks to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ now if we go to Deuteronomy chapter 20 you're going to find this passage that talks about the laws concerning Warfare and check this out says this a set of rules that the Israelites had to follow when engaging With the Enemy it says this when when you go out to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army larger than your own you shall not be afraid of them for the Lord your God is with you who brought you up out of the land of Egypt in other words when you're facing errors in your life that you say you used to say I was addicted when you're facing errors in your life to say man I'm never going to get free from that when you look at errors in your life and you say ah man that's generational I don't know if I'll ever break it it was in my father it was in my grandfather and it's running in me you've actually made an excuse you've determined that you're afraid of that thing the Bible says the first thing to do do not be afraid do not be afraid then it goes on to say this and when you draw near to the battle the priest shall come forward and speak to the people and shall say to them hear o Israel today you are drawing near for the battle against your enemies let not your heart think do not fear or Panic or be in dread of them for the Lord your God goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you the victory and to give you the victory did you get that the the New Testament the New Covenant is that God through Jesus has given you the victory under the old Covenant the type and Shadow was when you're drawn into the battle Don't Be Afraid in fact there's three things I need you to write these down firstly do not be afraid do not be afraid do not fear do not dismiss it like you'll never beat it do not say that it's too big for me do not say that this is a hereditary thing that this is a generational thing that this is stuck within me I'm not resigning to the fact that this is just a part of my life though I will not do that I am not afraid of that thing secondly God is with you the priests had to come and remind the people even if the enemy looked bigger than them even if they had more horses and more chariots and they were more intimidating the priest was to remind them that God is with you and thirdly God is fighting for you see this is crazy this is crazy I can tell you story after story where the Israelites would go into battle and they wouldn't even swing one sword God would fight for them that's like in our life God says first thing don't be afraid start calling some sin out I call in some areas out stop then start drawing some battle lines say sin this has been in my life too long lust I'm coming after you there's things anger the days are done literally start drawing some battle lines remind yourself God is with me that gives me the confidence to draw the battle line in the first place and then it says go into battle no then it says stop fighting no no it doesn't say that it says Don't Be Afraid God is with you God is fighting for you so you draw the battle lines God does the fighting foreign [Music]", "hey welcome to Five Church you have found us in our tongues of Fire series this series is all about the mystery of the Fate now revealed and this invisible Kingdom that we're a part of I know you're gonna be blessed by this content each and every week enjoy as we get into the word of God would you open to First Corinthians chapter 14. First Corinthians chapter 14 for the biblically astute you would already be shaking and aware of what we're about to partake of for those who are more ignorant in the word of God you are naively entering into a powerful passage of scripture and what we have in First Corinthians chapter 14 is the Apostle Paul presenting quite a contentious passage of scripture let me go ahead and read it to you it says pursue love and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts especially that you may prophesy for one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God for no one understands him but he utters mysteries in the spirit on the other hand the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation the one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself but the one who prophesies builds up the church now I want you all to speak in tongues but even more to prophesy the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues unless someone interprets so that the whole church may be built up for week two of our installment uh in in in tongues of fire I want to keep it real simple for the for the you know all the note takers all the all the people who like to write down the sermon title I'm going to keep it really simple really easy the title of the sermon today is speaking in tongues King in tongues you ready for the word of God today all right we'll remind your neighbor because your neighbor ain't sure your neighbor is uncertain I feel it from the stage so why don't you shake your neighbor real quick and say get ready we're about to speak in tongues let's go let's go so my twins turned 17 this week and I treated myself to a brand new firearm as a gift to myself I don't really care for your proclivities your political position on Firearms I encourage you to keep it to yourself in your face book followers but for me I'm a father of daughters and so it is my job to Serve and Protect my family right okay it's my job to Serve and Protect and I feel more uh equipped to do that with the right Arsenal so to speak you know when I'm prepared for any Intruder that may come my way be it an animal or a person I'm going to protect my family it is my job and to be honest with you the protection part is kind of easy it's the serving part I find difficult even all I'm talking about trying to connect with all the dads of daughters here the the protection part that instinct is natural I mean you mess with my daughters you mess with me as you we're gonna we're gonna find out how that goes for you but it's the serving part that is hard because I am the only male in my household that means if there is a bug to kill if there is anything to be lifted physically a jar to be opened if there is there is no rest for the man in our household I'm serving constantly I'll even find uh Kira at times will say what are you doing can you just relax I'm like relax wouldn't that be a novel idea how do you think things happen around this place the other day she caught me I was had these goggles on and a screwdriver and I was diving into the pool and she's like she literally said what are you doing now I said would you like to know what I'm doing now you see at the bottom of our pool at the 10 foot deep section there is a little grill that covers the inlet to make sure no rocks or you know anything that gets sucked in there and breaks the pool pumps so it broke so I have to dive down there and and fix it and and she's like well why don't you get someone to do that I said what a novel idea wouldn't that be grand I just get someone to fix it wouldn't be that I already talked to our pool guy who told me to fix it he's going to have to rent like scuba diving gear and he was telling me the cost and I said you know what I'm going to go ahead and keep my money because I got some skills it's only 10 feet I mean how long does it take to screw something in like 60 seconds I can do that so I did it here I am goggles on screwdriver in hand brand new little cover I dove down I realized quickly I can't hold my breath like on land I can hold it under what happens something changes but I got it done I got it done because as a man you can't always rely on other people sometimes you got to do things for yourself where are all the men at I mean I'm I'm a big believer in having people around you having people support you relying on others sharing the load being the body I love it but then sometimes there are some things that you've got to do for yourself sometimes you've got to do something not there aren't people that can do everything for you sometimes you're going to do some things for your self I want you to keep that in mind as we explore the scriptures today because what we have here in First Corinthians 14 as I said is arguably one of the most contentious passages of scripture prepared for us by Paul it presents a topic that is possibly more controversial today than it actually was for the original audience believe it or not because it illuminates a specific spiritual gift that for some reason has been used as as a tool to denote a specific denomination instead of reinforcing the mysterious nature of the Kingdom that we are all a part of it's a section of scripture that is ultimately focused on revealing the power of tongues and the power of the tongue and what we find the Apostle doing is he is comparing and he's contrasting the difference between two types of speaking which are unknown tongues and prophecy that's how he lays it out he compares the two now before we get into breaking these two elements down I wonder if you would allow me today to draw your attention for a moment to just how much emphasis the Bible places on the power of the tongue and speaking for that much for starters what you're going to find in Genesis in your Genesis account we find that speech was fundamental and foundational to the formation of the world we we see in Genesis chapter 1 that each creation phase was a result of God speaking and as a result of speaking things formed that as God spoke things were created as God merely spoke the word matter came from the speaking of the word Mata began to form things began to take shape not because of any other matter but at the at the actual word of God things began to appear and materialize at the word of God we see it all the way in Genesis chapter 1 verse 3 we find it says and God said let there be light and there was light we see it in Genesis 1 6 it says and God said let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters let it separate the waters from the waters verse 9 it says and God said let the waters under the heavens be gathered together in one place and let the dry land appear and it was so the same goes on and on we see in verse 11 verse 14 verse 24 verse 26 where God said let us make man in our own image and yet their man was formed and I like verse 27. maybe I could quickly read that to you because I feel like it's something that our society is confused on today it says in verse 27 so God created man in his own image in the image of God he created him male and female he created them just leave it there as a good pastor no it's not just Genesis but if we were to actually move Beyond Genesis and if I was actually to take you on a scriptural Journey throughout the Bible you will find that time and time again the Bible emphasizes the power of the tongue we see that by Proverbs in Proverbs we actually get an articulation of the very power that's in the tongue in Proverbs it says in 18 21 it says death and life are in the power of the tongue if we're to even fast forward to the New Testament in Mark chapter 16 verse 15 at the Greek commission this was Jesus's commission to us as the Saints to continue the ministry and the Redemptive work of Heaven we're going to find that the tongue is essential an essential element to the Fulfillment of the Great Commission the Great Commission to go out and preach to Proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ it says in Mark 16 15 it says and he said to them go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation now don't worry I love I love Instagram and stuff too I love a good quippy quote I love uh Francis Saint Francis of Assisi you know that that saying you know uh preach the good news and when necessary use words I love that because it's talking about you know live like a Christian model Christianity show kindness goodness you know make sure that by the way you live you're preaching the Good News but by my my goodness preach preach as well because the Great Commission is a commission to Proclaim it's to speak to preach now let your actions back up your words rather than your words precede your actions let let the way you live follow the fact that you are proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ and salvation in his name alone it's it's a powerful commission when you speak in fact Romans reveals this element of speaking also but from the reverse polarity Paul's kind of clever because time and time again they talk about the power of the tongue but in Romans 10 17 he says so faith comes by hearing and hearing through the word of Christ in other words he's saying faith is a result of hearing so someone better speak someone better preach someone better take the word of life and the word of God to begin to speak it in such a way that the people of God can hear it and let their faith be built because faith comes by hearing but someone's got to speak it are you here today Church I was warm up I'm gonna I'm gonna present a case to you today it's my plan most the time when I'm picturing you and preparing for you I I picked you on my side you know like it's not we're not against each other I picked you on my side that we're a team and we're all just exploring the word of God together like we would in a group a Bible study but today I I want a picture with my enemy and I want to present a case to you I want to try and convince you I've been watching a lot of Suits now it's on Netflix I've been watching the season again and I feel like Harvey and I feel like I just got to present a well-rounded case biblical case for you to convince you of what the Apostle Paul is trying to present to you today and if I'm going to do an emphatic job of talking about the power of tongues in the Bible I would have to also include James for you because in James what we find is that James gives us a warning when it comes to teaming the tongue because misunderstanding its power can actually be devastating James chapter 3 verse 4 says in a small Rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the pilot chooses to go and even even though the winds are strong in the same way the tongue is a small thing but makes Grand speeches but a tiny spot can set a great Forest on fire and among all the parts of the body the tongue is a flame of fire it is a whole world of wickedness corrupting the entire body it can set your whole life on fire for it is set on fire by hell itself Akira and I took a red eye recently and I don't recommend them we we do our best not to take red eyes but we had to be on the east coast and the only way to get there and fit everything in is we had to fly through the night and and we landed early and and we landed early enough to be the first person at the rental car counter you know what I'm talking about so we rock up to the rental car counter and they'd already opened up and there was ample people behind the counter we were the only people on the customer side but but no one was promptly serving us you ever experienced that where you're like um I I know you probably like to not be inconvenienced by a customer um and and continue your conversation but literally we're there for a few minutes and I'm not the I'll be honest I'm not the most patient person and so I like to just you know let my presence be known and and was just tapping on the counter you know just trying to ah hey hey guys I'm still staying sweet even though I have no sleep I'm still trying to stay sweet and and finally a lady came over and started to serve us only to inform us that there's a problem I said okay what's the problem they said well do you have the card the the credit card that you booked the trip on I said well no I don't have the card I feel like someone's got a witness they know what I'm talking about I don't have that card because that was a digital card that I used to make all my bookings I got other cards and they're like ah yeah you see we need that actual card I'm like well I don't have that actual card but I'll happily use any of my other cards because to me money's money you know where it comes from if it comes from Chase comes from Baker it's all money right it's all it's like you know wherever and they're like oh I'm so sorry uh okay cool um let me help you solve the problem that I believe you're employed to solve and she's like I can't do it I said what do you mean you can't do it I said there's nobody else here like do you have are you out of cars and she's like no no we we you have to cancel this one and then you're gonna have to call up and rebook enough I said but I'm talking to you you work for the company I literally said this my next sentence was for your safety and mine I am going to step back and allow my wife to take over I literally said that didn't I honey and see that's taming the tongue people that is literally self-control because we've been working on it haven't we baby I'm getting so much better it's the truth it's understanding the power of the tongue I was about to set the whole place on fire I'm telling you with words that were reading I was about to spit fire but I didn't attained it welcome but this is the power of the tongue the Bible knows about it that's why the psalmist says in Psalm 141 verse 3 set a god O Lord over my mouth keep watch over the door of my lips the psalmist understood it before I begin my day before I see my co-workers before I even speak to my kids God sent a guard over my mouth watch the door of my lips because what I want coming out I need it to be guarded it holds power it holds it holds holds power it could be devastating even Jesus himself emphasized this in Matthew chapter 15 verse 11 he says it's not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person you see he was talking to the Pharisees the Sadducees the followers of the religious law who were so articulate and careful in what they digested what they put in they didn't want to eat anything that was unclean however he's saying hey hey you guys are so meticulous and watching what you eat be you don't give one regard to what's coming out of your mouth the hypocrisy and the cursing and this Lander that comes out of your mouth he says it's not what goes in but what comes out that corrupts your life that's strong from Jesus that's powerful from Jesus he was de-emphasizing the religious elements and making people accountable for what they say because his life and his death in the tongue there's life and death in the tongue some of you are wondering why my world feels cursed and maybe you're speaking death into your own world I'll never get a job I'll never lose weight well you can go to the gym all you want but if you keep professing that you'll never lose weight you'll wonder why the treadmill don't work in your life because you're creating an environment that opposes the Breakthrough power of God the physical and the spiritual are connected they're highly interconnected but what we speak frames our world in fact what's interesting and we're just scratching the surface of the scriptures that talk about the tongue what's what I find interesting is just how much scripture emphasizes the power of the tongue even seemingly more than the power of the Mind I wonder why that is I wonder if scripture is revealing that the tongue can be powerful and also a destructive tool depending on how you use it depending on how you use it you see what we find from the Apostle is he he gives us a clear rank or albeit order when it comes to the use of tongues in the context of spiritual gifts in First Corinthians 14 he reveals two spiritual gifts that both require the use of the tongue and clearly he elevates prophecy as more important for instance he highlights that the one who prophesies speaks to individuals for their upbringing and their encouragement and as a bonus they also build up the church he makes this pretty clear that that I'm comparing and contrasting unknown tongues and prophecy and he's not backward about it he makes sure everyone knows that prophecy is better because it builds people up prophecy encourages people who hear it and the whole church benefit in fact he States in verse five he States pretty plainly that the one who prophesies is greater greater than the one who speaks in tongues not just the gift is greater but the the person who speaks prophecy is greater than the one who speaks in tongues now let me tell you why Paul makes this seemingly abrupt position by Illuminating what prophecy actually is can you bear with me for a moment next week we're going to go deeper in on Prophecy but I do need to touch the surface of it so that we can put in context what the Apostle Paul is presenting to us as the people of God you see prophecy is fundamentally a Divine message mediated through an individual that is directed at a person or a people group and is intended to elicit a specific response prophecy can in fact have a few different functions let me give you a few and possibly the most common understanding of Prophecy is the foretelling of future events this is known as predictive prophecy and it it often gives the recipient or even the witness Insight around the future plans of God this kind of Prophecy is what foretold the coming of Christ and is what Jesus fulfilled when he ministered through his miracles through his death his burial his resurrection and his Ascension he fulfilled the prophecy of foretelling future events now beside that you also have prophecy as admonition this can come in the form of a Divine warning in Comfort correction exhortation sometimes they they both simultaneously happen revealing the Oracles of judgment and salvation at the same time now prophecy can also serve a creative element framing the world around you this is what it means to speak life as I was saying or speak death that you have within the power of speaking a prophetic element to create to create in fact when when God spoke the world into existence he essentially prophesied it into existence since it activated creation that is still continually continuing to Ripple today so when God spoke the world into being he spoke to seed and that seed Goes Forth and bears trees those trees bear seed and those seeds bear trees that's not hard and those trees bear so there is a ripple effect of creation that God activated at creation but prophesied it so that even in future creation would continue to unfold and unravel this is what happened he prophesied it into the world which I think one of the greatest examples of this is of the creative power of Prophecy is actually with Gideon you know the story of Gideon when when Gideon was was was was encountered the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord found Gideon hiding in a wine press because he was afraid let's be frank he was afraid he's trying to go about his tasks in hiding and the angel of the Lord comes to Gideon and surprisingly says Mighty Man of Valor this is because the angel of the Lord was not speaking to what was but was speaking to what will be and he was prophesying an environment around Gideon that ultimately set the framework for him to become the Mighty Men of Valor that he wasn't in that moment see this is the power of Prophecy I am trying to preach to a people honey maybe you can do a better job next week preaching about prophecy but I'm trying to get you into the place to understand that God has good gifts for his people God has good gifts powerful gifts not token gifts that the spiritual gifts that God gives you are for power to change things to shift things to move environments to adjust things to empower people equip people so they can run essentially why Paul emphasizes the importance of this in the church that that prophecy builds up the church especially compared to unknown tongues which is kind of the opposite I mean even if a prophetic word isn't directed to you you can still benefit from hearing it because you understand what's being said unknown tongues on the other hand are not understood at least by you the unknown the Bible makes it pretty clear there mysterious they're Mysteries and let me explain because Paul says it like this in the beginning of of First Corinthians maybe I could go back there again he says pursue love and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts especially that you may prophesy now we're focused on the prophecy bit but I need to highlight that the Apostle Paul says something powerful there that I do not need you to miss he starts by saying desire spiritual gifts he says desire spiritual gifts he is Illuminating an invitation to ask for what's available to you the Apostle Paul would not ask you or command you or instruct you to desire something if there was not attainable to you so therefore what we know from the introduction is that the gifts that God has are available they're available they're not essential they're available I can go my whole life Walking with God never really tap into his power and the gifts that he has to me and will I enter into heaven absolutely but will I maximize my life and my walk with God will I ultimately touch into the very things that God has for me to actually rescue me and to push me and to propel me and to hold me have me as a leader no but they're available they're available and because they're available means they're not exclusive and this is important Paul had to touch on this because there were those within the church who who spoke in tongues who who by speaking in tongues they're speaking in tongues and they realize oh you don't do that oh he's like you know I I don't do that oh and all of a sudden they were positioning themselves in a hierarchical position of spirituality by I speak in tongues and you don't put presenting themselves and portraying themselves as more spiritual than others but Paul says let me make this clear they're available they're available therefore you can't use them as a rank or a hierarchy over others if anything he esteems prophecy as higher he says desire the spiritual grip gifts it's available then he goes on in verse two to reveal for one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God for no one understands him but he utters mysteries in the spirit he also says this in verse 14 for if I pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful so the origin with tongues is different from prophecy you see prophecy is part god part our mind we find that in Pro in the previous chapter in fact in First Corinthians 13 9 which says for we know in part and we prophesy in part this means that I'm inspired the word that I have in my spirit is inspired by the Holy Spirit but he uses my mind my vocabulary my accent my tradition what I know my language limitations he uses that to deliver the Divine word of God so it's a partnership is prophecy is it God speaking by all means but is it my filter absolutely because it's part prophecy part mind part me I've got to use my words my friend in other words my mind is not a robot and my mouth is not robotic just speaking what I don't even know it's clear it's concise it's articulated through what I have educated myself in with the word of God however what we find is that speaking in tongues is the opposite speaking in tongues while our mind is less engaged our spirit is highly engaged this is why it's also called praying in the spirit as it says in verse 14. now here's the question that I have for you if I'm gonna embody Harvey I want to make sure I bring a great case to the jury and ask the question why would it be useful as a gift if you don't even know what you're saying Paul was very clear how prophecy was beneficial for the hero and the whole body but because everyone understands it but what about speaking in unknown tongues when you yourself don't even know what you're saying well I want to highlight as a case for you Romans chapter 8 verse 26. in another section of scripture writing now to the Romans not the Corinthians Paul presents it like this he says verse 26 likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know what to pray as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words and he who searches Hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the Saints according to the will of God are you with me you ever prayed in a season of pain you ever been in a season of opposition and you felt the pain and the pressure and and all you find your prayer is God get me out that's the prayer now when you're facing pain and you're facing pressure the only prayer you know to pray is God take it away God get me out God remove this sickness God remove this season God get me out but what if God's plan is not to get you out but for him to get in what if God is looking to use the situation but in your immediacy of you trying to eliminate the pain all you're praying is what you know is God remove it God get me out of this situation missing the fact that just maybe God has a bigger plan than if you could just persevere instead of removing you what if he could gird himself with you and strengthen you and help you endure and help you persevere so that on the other side there would be a testimony of God's power and his provision but we don't know to pray that we don't know to pray that we don't know the pro you don't I'm walking by my feelings most of the time I'm just praying God remove this customer service agent I will go back there myself and Tinker away on that we pray through our pain but thank God the Holy Spirit knows what I don't know to pray thank God the Holy Spirit can pray with groanings and and deep depth that I don't know what to pray from a surface level even more specifically the purpose of speaking in tongues is revealed in verse 4 it says the one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself just as prophecy builds up others God gave you a gift to build yourself up which is praying in the spirit this is what Jude 20 reveals saying building yourselves up in the Most Holy Faith and praying in the Holy Spirit now if you're thinking okay that's pretty cool um pasta but yeah I've done I've done pretty good so far haven't prayed in tongues haven't had that gift and you know what yeah it's been rough at times but I've got this far I want to suggest that you haven't faced the right battles yet and I don't mean that in a condescending way but I wonder if there's battles that you will face that are ahead of you that God's trying to prepare you and equip you that if you would push Beyond a doctrinal background or an ancient teaching or a historical thing that you missed out on because the denominational lines that you grow up within you're missing an element to your faith that God is trying to equip you with to prepare you for what's ahead and I'm all for having people around you to fight with you to build you up we see that with David David he faced many battles in fact he had mighty men that girded around him and supported him in his conquests but there was one battle that David fought that no one could fight for him there was one battle that hit him harder than the other battles and we find it in first Samuel chapter 30 can I show you real quick these are my closing arguments [Music] in first Samuel 30 we see a story where David says and his men verse 1 came to ziklag on the third day and the amalekites had made a raid against the Negev and against ziklag and they had overcome ziglag and burned it with fire and taken captive the women and all who were in it both small and great they killed no one but they carried them off and went their way and when David and his men came to the city they found it burned with fire and their wives and Sons and Daughters taken captive then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weep David's two wives also had been taken captive of Jezreel and Abigail the Widow of nabel and the bulk of Carmel and David check this out was greatly distressed for the people spoke of stoning him because all the people were bitter in Seoul each for his sons and daughters David's in a dark place David's in a place where no one around him can support him because they all hate him he's now isolated and alone they're blaming him for the loss of the people because he was meant to lead them into Victory and the people that he could rely on to build him up the people that may be able to give a prophetic word in that moment and encourage his body they weren't there so what we find is something unique it then goes on to say but David strengthened himself in the Lord his God David strengthened himself he had no one to strengthen him so he had to go to that place where he could strengthen himself where he could edify himself where he could fortify himself in the Lord he had to find a new way he couldn't just rely on those around him sometimes you need to edify and fortify yourself sometimes you don't need the doubt or even the reality permeating around your mind and diminishing your face sometimes you you need to pray what your spirit knows to pray but you don't know what to pray [Music] this ain't this ain't for everyone it's for you that's what tongues is it's not for everyone else it's for you Paul's very clear prophecies for everyone else tongues is for you but how good is God that he gives you a gift that in the season where you have no one around you to build you up you have a source of strength to edify yourself and build yourself in such a way that it doesn't kill you from the race you can keep running no no let me get this clear your honor well Paul contrasts tongues and prophecy he emphasizes that there's no conflict between them he's contrasting them he's comparing them but he wants the hearers to know there's no competition with them he says it this way in verse 15 let me show you he says what am I to do good question now that I know the power of Prophecy and I understand the power of speaking in tongues what am I to do one's for others that's beneficial ones for me and to be honest I need it what am I to do he says I know I'll pray with my spirit but I'll pray with my mind also I'll sing praise with my spirit but I'll sing praise with Life Worship also I need I know what I need I need both it's not either or it's both hand see this is the this is the goodness of God that he has given you every spiritual gift in Christ Jesus that he's like hey it's available it's available it's available if you want it you can have it it's available if you need it why don't you take it it's available it's for you but it's it's gonna be unlocked by you so so how do I access it now that we know that the Holy Spirit has the gift of tongues for us the gift of Prophecy how do I access it if it's available how do I access it well last week we spoke about being baptized in the Holy Spirit we talk about being filled with the spirit because we leak we in other ways to say we get drained people anybody anybody draining people in your life anybody just be honest if my staff raise their hand please don't let it be your boss but we're draining people we've got demands you've got pressures you've got the world will drain you that's why you need to keep returning to the presence of God being filled with his Spirit continually I ain't gonna re-preach last week but it's a great Foundation to build upon and so we know that once you're filled with the spirit the next step is to and this is profound ask by faith to ask by faith simply say holy spirit what you've got I won before today I didn't even know what was available to me but now I've come into the revelation of what's available let me actually equip my appetite that is now forming within me not let it just be an appetite but let it be an Ask Let It Be an Ask by faith to say God by faith I want what you've got if there is any spiritual gifts that are in the storeroom of Heaven let them not sit there let them be in my account let them be in my life let me access it by faith [Music] thank you"]
