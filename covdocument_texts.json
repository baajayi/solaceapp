God we are here in his house this morning um and we're going to start off the service this morning we're going to kick it off with some musical worship we going to be singing these songs out to the Lord our God God you know something that happens in worship is um it's not just this kind of ritualistic thing that we come and sing a bunch of notes repeat some words on the screen right but it's us taking our hearts and offering them up to the Lord um giving him the worship that we desire so you know the bands up here we're playing right but like it's not about us it's not the band it's not the

amen all right welcome again uh kids are dismissed for kids church out the doors that way if you're in Like Preschool you go into Fellowship Hall otherwise up the stairs the you uh if you're in grade 6 to 12 you're staying with us today congratulations that's you Kimmy you get to stay all right so um we're going to take this time to greet each other I was um having a conversation in the fellowship hall uh with um with Luke with Peter and Sierra about places to eat in New York and it got me thinking since I grew up in New York uh about food that I kind of miss um and so for example I miss uh these ice cream trucks in New York called Mr Softy if you grew up in New York you know what I'm talking about um soft s of ice cream rainbow sprinkles was always my thing I haven't had it in a very long time and I talking about that got me feel feeling wistful about that so turn to someone in the pews near you greet each other and the Icebreaker question what's a food that you miss a little bit it could be someone in your family that made something treasured right or it could be a restaurant it could be a guilty pleasure like me so we'll take this time just to greet each other and share about some food oh okay I hope you shared some good tasty ideas or memories with each other um I and there a good prelude for the announcements coming up um so number one uh we have these uh connect cards in the pews I'll pulling up these yellow things here so you can fill these out if you are new alternatively you can also fill these out for prayer requests and here's my plug so most of the time these things sit in a pews and they're not and they're pretty empty and occasionally we get like a couple but because they're for prayer requests I would argue that if we have to replenish these constantly for prayer requests that's a good thing so don't be bashful and please take the opportunity to fill one of these out with a prayer request uh the staff do review them right and look at them and pray over them so very very good use if you grab one of these don't be bashful so number two um if we move on let's see here today is very exciting because right after service uh we have uh Community lunches so uh the community lunches are an opportunity right after service to go to a house or something nearby and eat lunch with each other and get to know one another so as I am my wife we're hosting one we live 10 blocks away uh so we're very excited about that I know there are many many others happening if you have not signed up already that is okay because you can uh sign up at the end or after service here um you can go to the blue tent in the fellowship hall and uh we will hook you up with a lunch but it's a lot of fun to get to know other people and to connect with one another and share some some food um possibly develop a new treasured thing to eat so that is the uh that's the community lunches and coming up in a about a week actually next week May 5th can you believe it's may already uh my main thought about May is this allergy season so I woke up this morning and my eyes were itchy so I have very mixed feelings about May um but one of the good things in May is that we are are having this uh future of Central Square Workshop uh it's being held here at church uh there are going to be um a number of people speaking you can hear from members of the church who grew up in a neighborhood um and I think that this neighborhood that we live in in the Central Square area is like super interesting has gone through a tremendous amount of change at the same time right because there's so much uh planning that's happening with the city and with their neighborhood and different organizations and their churches like there's a a big uh path forward and question around what the future looks like and so it is an opportunity to engage in that conversation so uh encourage you to join all are welcome no sign up necessary okay those are the big announcements for today so we're going to continue our worship time now uh with the time of offering um so uh it's an act giving and offering is an act of worship where we get to really think about the ways um and reflect on the ways that God has provided for us uh and everything comes ultimately from God so uh you can give by scanning the QR code uh we can text as well uh or does the offering plates uh which are coming around um and while the plates go around I'm going to give us a moment just to think about ways we can be that we can be grateful or thankful for God um and so one thing I'm thankful for uh today um is is actually the neighborhood um just over the weekend uh on Saturday there our kids go to the school down there there was uh yesterday there was a dance Workshop a West African dance Workshop we had friends with uh some folks in the school this morning we were at a local bakery ran into another friend from the school and it's just just great to be part of this community here uh in Central Square so that's what I'm grateful for today so I'm going to invite the hospitality team to come up um and walk around with the offering plates and in this time let's just take an opportunity to reflect on things that you might be grateful for [Music] let's pray for the offering dear God we thank you because you provide for all of our needs your generosity Knows No Limits and is boundless um and we present our offering to you as an act of worship an act of gratitude Act of remembering where everything comes from uh an an act of Hope as well that what we provide to you will be multiplied in the service of your kingdom and the work that you do so we pray that you would bless this offering offing and that you would be honored in it and that your work would continue through us and through your spirit here name we pray amen okay so today's um today's uh worship or sorry scripture reading is in Ezra chapter 4 verse 1-5 uh I actually have a different version of Pew Bible than the one you have because I have the large print version that I can read it I'm getting old and it's it's and the the the the font in the pews is really small um so but you can also follow along up there on the thing but so I'm going to read from the large print version and the reality is the large print version isn't that large it says large it says large print on here like you can see that right I got fool I got fooled all right here we go uh Ezra chapter 4 verse 1-5 when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the Exiles were building a temple for the Lord the god of Israel they came to zerubabel and to the heads of the families and said let us help you build because like you we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time e Asar hadan king of Assyria who brought us here but zerubabel Joshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered you have no part with us in building a temple of our to our God we alone will build it for the Lord the god of Israel as king Cyrus the King of Persia commanded us then the peoples around them set to set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building they bribe officials to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus King of Persia and down to the reign of Darius King of Persia sure the word of the Lord the word of the Lord I Haven been presiding in a long time so this is Dan he's a long long time member here at the church he you were here before I got to the church I believe almost 20 years ago and um he presided Services probably like 10 years ago and he's back again this is his debut return um so I'm grateful for you thank you I have stories about [Laughter] Larry oh my goodness oh my goodness good morning church good morning oh man let me get set up here uh if you don't know who I am uh I'm Pastor Larry one of the pastors here at the church and I have uh the privilege of bringing the word of God to you um here this morning um yeah last week last week if you were here we started uh a brand new sermon series called build together where we are walking through two books of the Bible Ezra and Nehemiah um and these two books were originally one book they were split into two sometime in the 9th century uh but these two books were meant to be treated as a singular unit and so that's how we will treat it as well and last week what we said was that uh build together is not only a sermon series it's a season that we are calling the church into where we are looking to deepen the uh the connection uh and the community here in this church uh if you aren't familiar uh this church went through a merger between two very different congregations ations uh and then moved into this building all of that happened in the middle of the pandemic and so when we came out of the pandemic the landscape of this community had changed noticeably changed on top of that the people who have joined this church since the merger now outnumber the people who are here before the merger so this has been a really exciting season it has uh to witness such a dynamic and growing and Community but the changes here mean that we have to be intentional about building Community here to that end um we've put these postcards inside of your bulletins um that and we've created if you look there just multiple ways for us to build together to connect with one another and the theme Here is not only connection but building building uh and it's because one of the most effective ways to to get to know people and to connect is by going shoulder-to-shoulder and and learning with them uh and and serving with them and dreaming with them so most immediately today as as Dan mentioned we have Community lunches next week we have that Workshop called the future of Central Square you're going to hear from members of this church who grew up in this neighborhood business owners who grew up in this neighborhood um and we're going to hear about how we as a church can influence and impact what our neighborhood will look like now and into the future uh this will not be a theoretical exercise um our neighborhood is currently going through a visioning process with the entire city uh and I'll share more about that during the workshop next week and we as a church are going to have a very significant role to play uh in what this neighborhood feels like what this neighborhood values um what kind of shops will be here what kind of Commerce will be here what kind of people will be here we're going to have significant input into all of those different factors uh so that's next week uh open to everyone okay today we're in the book of Ezra we are covering chapters 4 through six and uh there is a lot there I'm not going to read it verse by verse so don't panic um but we will get into it all right you guys ready yes yes yes okay let me pray for us and we're going to take a look Lord God we thank you for this morning God we thank you that um we are alive in the land of the living as they say you you put breath in our lungs as we woke up this morning and every single day is a gift that has been given to us by our creator and so God this Sunday is not just a day life is too short for that today is a day that we treasure today is a day that we honor today is a day that we celebrate and come together and we seek your face we pray these things Lord in your name amen amen all right we're going to look at Ezra chapter 4 Ezra chapter 4 and we need to do a little bit of background before we get into it all right so here's the background and we covered this last week so hopefully this is review for for many of you last week we shared that in 586 BC the Babylonian Empire they invade Israel and they send the Israelites into Exile and then they destroy the capital city of jerus Jerusalem and most importantly they destroy the temple at the heart of the city and the people of God cry out and they're like God where are you and God promises to restore them and this is what the story of Ezra is about because in Ezra Chapter 1 what we find out is that there is a new superpower called the Persians led by King Cyrus and the Persians defeat the Babylonians and what we're told in Ezra chapter 1 is that God stirs the heart of of King Cyrus and King Cyrus is compelled to tell the people of God that they can go back to Jerusalem and rebuild their Homeland and rebuild the Temple what we are told is that two figures zerubabel and the high priest Joshua they lead the first wave of Israelites back to their Homeland and the rebuilding process begins and everything goes well until today Ezra chapter 4 this is where we pick up the story all right Ezra chapter 4 the scripture will be up there is that large enough print just kidding okay Ezra chapter 4 aging is not funny it's a series of losses is what I people told me all right Ezra chapter 4 Ezra chter 4: one it says when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the Exiles were building a temple for the Lord the god of Israel they came to zerubabel and to the heads of the families and said let us help you you build because like you we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of that name king of Assyria who brought us here but zerubabel Joshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered you have no part with us in building a temple to our God we alone will build it for the Lord the god of Israel as king Cyrus the King of Persia commanded us then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building they bribed officials to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus King of Persia down to the reign of Darius King of Persia let's stop there zerubabel and Joshua they lead the charge to go rebuild the Temple and then we're told that a group of people offers to help who are these people apparently when the Israelites were taken into Exile not everybody went there was a Remnant that stayed behind and really they were left behind in Jerusalem and these were apparently the poor and the marginalized these are people that that when Babylon invaded they were like we don't want those people they can just stay and so there's a remnant of people who stay in Jerusalem and that Remnant ends up intermarrying with the people who end up drifting into that area and here you have the origin story for an entire people group known as the Samaritans and the Samaritans from this point are despised and they're despised really because of their mixed race they are Jewish and Fillin the blank these Samaritans these people of mixed race and and even unknown race they come to zerubabel they come to Joshua and they say hey we've been hanging out here in Jerusalem this entire time we also worship the same God can we help you build this temple in zerubabel and Joshua they say you have no part with us in building a temple to our God we alone will build it for the Lord the god of Israel as king Cyrus King of Persia commanded us we are not given any reason why this is the response but things take an ugly turn here a really ugly turn after their offer of help is rejected these Samaritans then become the enemies of Israel and they seek to rebuild uh to frustrate um and stop the rebuilding of Jerusalem for many many many years to come fast forward fast forward um in Ezra chapter 4 and you have a new king uh the king's name is araz Xerxes somebody say Artis Xerxes arer Aris Xerxes right son of Xerxes if you watch the movie 300 Xerxes Artis Xerxes okay Artis Xerxes and and in Ezra chapter 4 the Samaritans write a letter to King araz Xerxes and they tell the king that the Israelites are wicked and rebellious and subversive and sedici and what they tell the king is man these people when when Jerusalem was destroyed it was destroyed for good reason these are bad people they should not be allowed to rebuild Jerusalem and so AR Xerxes receives this letter and he agrees and he puts a stop to everything Ezra 4:4 says thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius King of Persia the rebuilding project here stops everything stops for about 15 years 15 years everything stops then we have Ezra chapter 5 and in Ezra chapter 5 you you got to fast forward 15 years and now we have a new king another king named King Darius somebody say Darius Darius so King Darius is now on the throne and during the reign of King Darius there are two prophets in Israel who rise up named Hagi and Zechariah these two prophets are are they have their own books of the Bible right and haggi and Zechariah they decide to restart the rebuilding project of Jerusalem and Hagi and Zechariah they're like this lethal onew punch they're Jason Tatum jayen Brown right and porzingis we have a good team this year but there this lethal onew punch and and Hagi goes to the people and says fix God's house rebuild the Temple and Zechariah goes to the people and says fix your worship rebuild your spiritual lives and so these two they kind of like play off each other and they restart the process of rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem the problem is that now when they start to rebuild the Temple it is illegal to do so the previous King King AR of Xerxes remember he had this decree saying that this cannot happen so there is immediate push back and the government confronts Hagi and Zechariah and the people of Israel and they're like what are you doing here what you're doing here is illegal and the Israelites they respond by saying this Ezra 5:1 they say we are the Servants of the god of Heaven and Earth and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago one that a great king of Israel built and finished but because our ancestors angered the god of Heaven he gave them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the caldan king of Babylon who destroyed this Temple and deported the people to Babylon however in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God now if it pleases the king let a search be made in the Royal Archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem then let the king send us his decision in this matter uh the people of God here uh Zechariah and and Hagi they're they're very Savvy they're politically Savvy and so they go and they go to the government and they talk to Darius and they send him a message and they say yes it is illegal for us to build a temple but originally if you do your research there was this other decree by King Cyrus who gave us permission to do this work go and do your research and so King dar IUS does the research and in Ezra chap 6 King Darius concludes that the work should resume the work should continue and that no one should interfere with them Ezra 6: 7-12 this is King Darius he says this he says do not interfere with the work on this temple of God let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish Elders rebuild this house of God on its sight moreover I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews in the construction of this house of God their expenses are to be fully paid out in the Royal treasury from their revenues of the transr so that the work will not stop uh let me skip to verse 11 furthermore I decree that if anyone defies this edict a beam is to be pulled from their house and they are to be impaled on it and for this crime their house is to be made a pile of rubble may God who has caused his name to dwell there over throw any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this Temple in Jerusalem I Darius have decreed it let it be carried out with diligence King Darius he pays for the project and he puts his military might behind the effort and the people of Israel they respond by celebrating they respond by celebrating and in chapter 6: 19 it states that on the 14th day of the first month the Exiles celebrated the Passover for 7even days they celebrated with joy the Festival of unleavened bread because the Lord had filled them with Joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God the god of Israel right and that's where we're going to stop not the sermon just the scripture let me recap what we just did here all right let me recap uh chapters 4 4 through 6 the people of God they rebuild the Temple and then it gets stopped Hagi and Zechariah come and they rebuild again and then he gets stopped and then they go before King Darius and they make their case and then they rebuild again so when the people of God build and they're building together it's not a very linear path yesterday um I dropped off my kids um at the youth retreat um our youth did an overnight youth retreat um um at a campsite of sorts on the NorthShore um and they spent time in nature and they slept on the ground in these like looks like storage sheds um but when I got there man the the sun was out and yesterday the the weather was just gorgeous and I went to one of the youth leaders and I was like man the weather is incredible and he said yes it is incredible but did you know that tonight it drops to 30\u00b0 and I said no I did not know that and he said we are going to build some character this weekend shout out to all our youth leaders and what they do for us cuz they they spent the night there last night and are they here today I don't know if they made it [Laughter] back we are going to build some character this weekend but as I heard that I was like man this is just like so much of life right so much of life is like this we wish that life were more linear we wish that life was easier but but the trials the twists the turns they have a way of teaching us don't they they have a way of of of shaping us and building us we are all in one way shape or form formed and and forged by the fires that we've been in and this is true as well for the people of God here in the book of Ezra so many stops and starts and stops and starts but it is formative for them and it teaches them some really invaluable lessons of what it takes and what it means to be a community and to build together so what are these lessons all right what are these lessons first lesson is perseverance perseverance what we see here in the book of Ezra is that building together is slow work somebody say slow workow work it is slow work it's not instant it takes time and for every two steps forward it can feel like you're taking a step back so Building Together requires perseverance and grit and time uh I'm struck by our story here today where there's this pause between the first rebuilding and the second rebuilding there's a break of 15 years 15 years where it feels like nothing is happening 15 years where all their dreams had just kind of like died 15 years where it felt like building together yet that's not happening right but not everyone gives up these two prophets Hagi and Zechariah they try to rebuild again and if I were there and I suspect if many of you were there during that time we would have said we already tried that 15 years ago like we already tried it it didn't work it didn't work let's move on but Hagi and Zechariah they persist and they persevere and they've remind us that community and building a community Community is something you have to fight for and often times can get really messy and often times isn't very linear and it takes time building our community here is going to take time it's going to take time and there going to be Seasons where where Community will feel like it comes easy um and we'll feel connected but there will also be Seasons where Community feels Out Of Reach and disconnected there will be Seasons where it just feels like the community is humming and other seasons where it feels like nothing is happening I joined this community uh about 20 years ago um when I first came I was in my mid to late 20s and I felt instantly out of place um here in this church a lot of it had to do with the fact that I'm from California and I am culturally Californian and Californians are laidback and chill and most of you are not so when I came to this church I always sat in the back row right in the very very very back row and for those of you who were at church at that time like you know that I sat in the very very back row so all the back row people you're that's my move and and I have much love for all the back row people but that's what I did that was my move but 20 years later as I'm standing here I'm like I'm so grateful for this community and it doesn't feel like it's the community that I chose but it's a community that was given and gifted to me this community has walked with me through many seasons of Life marriage and kids walk with me through the death of my son all the highs and the lows and the in between but it wasn't always easy or obvious or natural it's something that I had to recommit to time and time and time again and so I'm encouraged by examples in the Bible like the book of Ezra of communities that stop and start and go up and down but ultimately slowly and surely they grow into the Beloved Community because God's hand is upon that Community the second lesson here is identity identity in our story today uh when the work of rebuilding the temple is shut down and challenged the people of Israel respond by saying we are the Servants of God of Heaven and Earth and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago one that a great king of Israel built and finished what do they do here they say who they are and they share a little bit of their history they share a little bit of their story it's so important here not only for the people back then but for the people here today in 2024 that as we build together we need to know who we are we need to know our identity but we also need to know our history and we need to know our stories and share our stories at the end of Ezra chapter 6 the people of God celebrate by celebrating Passover together Passover is a meal and a celebration but it's also a remembrance right it's a remembrance of what God did for Israel back in the book of Exodus when they were enslaved in Egypt and subsequently emancipated by the hand of God so when the people celebrate Passover they are again remembering their identity and they are retelling their story this has to be one of the most powerful ways to build together who are we and to tell your story I think especially in this church especially in this church we have people who are coming from every Walk of Life you should see the view that I have from here from every Walk of Life people are coming here and it can be sometimes just confusing and disorienting to be surrounded by people of all different ages and backgrounds so we especially I think need to be reminded regularly of who we are we are the people of God and we come together not because we all like the same things it's not because we all share the same Hobbies it's because we have Christ in common Christ as Lord Of Our Lives or if we're seeking then then Christ is the source of our curiosity and in this place we need to share our stories and continue to share Stories the number of people in this church who I'm meeting for the first time and I'm like I don't know who this person is but then I hear their story and I feel just connected and I'm like whoa what a story thank you for sharing that everybody needs to hear that one writer puts it this way she says the shortest distance between two people is a story this has to be one of my favorite sayings this is a phrase that I've heard used in in church churches all over the place and it's one of my favorite favorite sayings because sharing stories and creating spaces to share stories has a way of transcending the the the barriers that are between us the differences between us and I think that's part of of of the hope of the events that we're running for the Build Together season including the community lunches uh this afternoon it's an opportunity to not only share a meal with people but perhaps to hear their story to hear their Journeys right final final lesson here is purpose purpose this one's important", " they all are this is important when the people of Israel they began to rebuild the Temple the Samaritans offered to help but again here was the response you have no part with us in building a temple to our God we alone will build it for the Lord the god of Israel as king Cyrus the King of Persia commanded us all the challenges and struggles that we find in the book of Ezra seem to begin with that moment and why do the people of Israel refuse the help and there's so many theories here right maybe they knew that this group was going to be their enemies maybe they knew that that that that this group was going to you know push back on them and divert their efforts maybe they knew that stuff right but really I I think the most compelling reason they refused is because of nationalism and pride Israel believed that they and they alone I mean this is their exact wording we alone will build it they believe that they and they alone were God's chosen people and nobody else would be a part of this project I lived in Omaha Nebraska for 4 years and I remember living in Omaha Nebraska and uh as an Asian in Omaha Nebraska is a different story and I remember going to a Christian Gathering and in that Gathering um the leader there said Nebraska is God's chosen people and I was like what are you talking about and he said Nebraska is the heartland of America it is right in the center of everything and so when Revival happens it'll happen through Omar Nebraska and it will affect the entire country and the entire world and everyone was like yes and even I was kind of caught up and I was like yes that makes sense but when I got home I was like that makes no sense I mean again no offense cuz I I live there I live there but people don't care about Nebraska I couldn't find it on a map you know before I lived there for a big part of my 20s and I have much love for Nebraska but but what was that you know it reminded me of of when I was in college I went to a retreat and it was for a Korean Retreat it was all Koreans and the speaker was Korean and the Korean uh speaker got up there and said Koreans are God's chosen people Koreans are like the Israelites just like the Israelites they were enslaved and oppressed and yet their faith flourishes God will save the world through Korea and Kore Ians now this narrative makes more sense right this one I'm like hey it's still kind of small part of me Still Still believes this why do I want to believe this because at the heart of of that narrative is it it puts my people at the center of the story Israel they thought of themselves at the center of the story and how could they not if anybody's going to be at the center of the story it's Israel right and they thought of the problem is they missed their points and their purpose and what ends up fueling them here and later is a sense of deep nationalism and they believe they're special not because of God but because they are Israel they miss something huge here when they don't partner up and work with the surrounding Nations when they don't work with the Samaritans who they have ties to in history they miss an opportunity here and what's confounding here is that man this was prophesied the hope was that they would be working together and there were prophets who predicted this Isaiah chapter 2 says this Isaiah says many people will come and say come let us go to the mountain of the Lord to the Temple of the god of Jacob he will teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths the law will go out from Zion the word of the Lord from Jerusalem he will judge between the Nations and will settle disputes for many peoples they will beat their swords into plowshares their Spears into pruning hooks Nation will not take up sword against Nation nor will they train for war anymore that's right Merl calm descendants of Jacob let us walk in the light of the Lord this is the prophet Isaiah he's not the only one the prophet Micah says this many nations will come and say come let us go to the mountain of the Lord to the Temple of the god of Jacob he will teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths the law will go out from Zion the word of the Lord from Jerusalem he will judge between many peoples will settle disputes for strong Nations far and wide and they will beat their swords into plowshares and their Spears into pruning hooks Nation will not take up sword against Nation nor will they train for war anymore everyone will sit under their own Vine and under their own fig tree and no one will make them afraid for the Lord Almighty has spoken all the nations may walk in the name of their gods but we will walk in the name of the Lord Our God forever and ever Shalom wholeness peace no one will be afraid so when these Samaritans this group who are seen as Outsiders but these this group that has seen as Outsiders they've been living on that land for generations and have a claim on that land and when that group offers to join Israel what could have been a beautiful fulfillment of Isaiah 2 and Micah 4 turns into strife and friction even the good news of King Darius saying I will support this project comes with the threat of violence against all who oppose it King Darius says anybody who opposes this who's who's who's who's opposing them it's the Samaritans and so Darius is like whoever opposes them will be impaled will be gruesomely executed he threatens violence what a mess and it stays a mess until Jesus comes and Jesus Will intentionally what does he do he intentionally goes to the Samaritans and he goes to the Samaritan cities and he talks to the Samaritan woman at the well and he tells a parable about a Good Samaritan and every time Jesus says the word word Samaritan trust me everybody tenses up the people of Israel they tense up because the Samaritans have been their enemies for so long they can't imagine or remember a time where that wasn't the case and in the book of Ezra right you see here the Samaritans end up doing some really grimy stuff they end up doing some really subversive stuff to the people of Israel and so when Jesus goes to the Samaritan and talks about the Samaritans and talks about a Good Samaritan the people of Israel have to be thinking Jesus don't you care don't you know the history don't you know how they have hurt us in the past and stood in our way if they did this to us then we should do this to them but Jesus is trying to get this message through he's saying that Samaritans are not an innocent people but neither are you and the purpose of the temple the purpose of Jerusalem the purpose of the people people of Israel the purpose of building together is to be a light to the Nations and to bring peace and when you stray from that objective in any way shape or form this world will look more like hell and less like the kingdom that Jesus came to bring the purpose of us Building Together in this season there is much at stake because when we build together not just us there are churches all over the world world when we build together as the people of God we build for a purpose and that is to be a blessing and a light in a very dark place to be ambassadors of peace and Shalom and wholeness and healing and to join in with our God who is recreating and restoring this world and putting all things to rights when we Build Together We join our voices with everyone in our city and everyone in this world who is clamoring for things to be renewed and made right let it be so in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit amen I'm going to give you a couple moments to just reflect and then we're going to transition into a time of communion for the gospels they tell us that on the first day of the week the day our Lord rose from the dead he appeared to some of his disciples and was made known to them in the breaking of bread it is true for us as well Christ has made known to us as we break this bread and drink this cup together as we prepare to come to the Lord's table we reflect on our reasons for Thanksgiving and faith and our need for forgiveness and love in this time of Silence we remember our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who called us to share this meal together and we thoughtfully examine the state of our faithfulness in our Unity with his body I'm going to invite the hospitality team to come on up here I'm going to give you a moment just to [Music] reflect sisters and brothers this is food for the journey to which God has called us let our lives be nourished by the Lord himself as we celebrate together at this table the Apostle Paul tells us that on the night on which Jesus was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and he said this is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me Paul goes on to tell us that in the same way after supper he took the cup saying this cup is the New Covenant in my blood do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me Paul then reminds us that whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup we proclaim the death of Jesus until he comes again this is the Lord's table it is Jesus himself who invites you to this meal the table is open to all who believe and have professed faith in Jesus Christ if you are unfamiliar with the way that we take communion here we form two lines coming down uh the middle of the sanctuary um and once you're at the front there are four stations they are identical once you have those elements you can return to your seats and you can hold on to those elements cuz I will lead you so that we can take those elements together we will dismiss by section I'm going to dismiss this middle section first then afterwards for everybody who's Seated on the outside row I'll dismiss you afterwards um if you in the balconies today you can stay where you are somebody from the hospitality team will come to you all right uh the table it's now open uh middle section come on up e for for for [Music] for for Take and Eat the body of Christ broken for you take and drink the blood of Christ shed for you amen if you are able I'm going to invite you to
